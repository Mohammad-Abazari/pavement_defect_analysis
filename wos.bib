To minimize damage to vehicles from pavement defects or provide the corresponding comfortable ride promotion strategy later, in this study, we developed a pavement defect detection system using a deep learning perception scheme for implementation on Xilinx Edge AI platforms. To increase the detection distance and accuracy of pavement defects, two cameras with different fields of view, at 70 degrees and 30 degrees, respectively, were used to capture the front views of a car, and then the YOLOv3 (you only look once, version 3) model was employed to recognize the pavement defects, such as potholes, cracks, manhole covers, patches, and bumps. In addition, to promote continuous pavement defect recognition rate, a tracking-via-detection strategy was employed, which first detects pavement defects in each frame and then associates them to different frames using the Kalman filter method. Thus, the average detection accuracy of the pothole category could reach 71%, and the miss rate was about 29%. To confirm the effectiveness of the proposed detection strategy, experiments were conducted on an established Taiwan pavement defect image dataset (TPDID), which is the first dataset for Taiwan pavement defects. Moreover, different AI methods were used to detect the pavement defects for quantitative comparative analysis. Finally, a field-programmable gate-array-based edge computing platform was used as an embedded system to implement the proposed YOLOv3-based pavement defect detection system; the execution speed reached 27.8 FPS while maintaining the accuracy of the original system model.

Although many excellent crack defect detection algorithms have emerged, the detection effect on the edge details of the crack defects is still not ideal. In this paper, we propose a novel global-local fusion network based on edge enhancement and Transformer for pavement crack defect segmentation. Aiming at the structural characteristics of the pavement crack defects, combined with the edge detection algorithm (Sobel), an edge feature enhancement (EFE) module is presented to realize the accurate extraction of local detail information of the pavement crack defects. Meanwhile, a Transformer-based encoding path is also built to extract rich global information. Faced with the two different types of feature information, an adaptive fusion (AF) module is proposed to realize the efficient fusion of the two types of feature information. Furthermore, an attention-based local feature enhancement (ALFE) module and an edge refinement module (ER) are proposed to further suppress the interference in the local feature maps and refine the edge features of the pavement crack defects. Finally, a multi-scale feature enhancement (MFE) module is presented for multi-scale attention feature representation, by which we can provide high-quality input features for the decoding side.

Therefore, this paper used a mask region-based convolutional neural network (Mask R-CNN) and transfer learning to detect pavement defects in complex backgrounds. Twelve hundred pavement images were collected, and a dataset containing corresponding instance labels of the defects was established. Based on this dataset, the performance of the Mask R-CNN was compared with faster region-based convolutional neural networks (Faster R-CNNs) under the transfer of six well-known backbone networks. The results confirmed that the classification accuracy of the two algorithms (Mask R-CNN and Faster R-CNN) was consistent and reached 100%; however, the average precision (AP) of the Mask R-CNN was higher than that of Faster R-CNNs. Meanwhile, the testing time of the models using a feature pyramid network (FPN) was lower than that of other models, which reached 0.21 s per frame (SPF). On this basis, the segmentation performance of the Mask R-CNN was further analyzed at three learning rates (LRs). The Mask R-CNN performed best with ResNet101 plus FPN as its backbone structure, and its AP reached 92.1%. The error rate of defect quantification was between 4% and 16%.

The fact that 3D defect detection methods is superior to traditional 2D methods and manual survey methods in terms of accuracy and comprehensiveness has been widely recognized. Based on 3D laser scanning pavement data, an automatic defect detection method is proposed to detect pavement cracks and pavement deformation defects information simultaneously in this paper. Specifically, a sparse processing algorithm for 3D pavement profiles is first designed to extract crack candidate points and deformations support points, these processing is based on the assumption that the cracks are microscopic local defects while deformations are macroscopic defects in profiles. Then, the crack information can be detected by combining the extracted candidate points and an improved minimum cost spanning tree algorithm. On the other hand, the deformation depth information is acquired based on the profile standard contours which are constructed by profile envelopes and deformation support points, the accurate location and classification information of deformation defects can be obtained by the regional depth property. Experimental tests were conducted using real measured 3D pavement data containing two categories of defects. The experimental results showed that, based on the 3D laser scanning data, the proposed method can effectively detect typical cracks under different road conditions and environments, with the detection accuracy above 98%.

abstract = {Pavement defects such as cracks, net cracks, and pit slots can cause potential traffic safety problems. The timely detection and identification play a key role in reducing the harm of various pavement defects. Particularly, the recent development in deep learning (DL)-based convolution neural networks (CNNs) has shown competitive performance in image detection and classification. To detect pavement defects automatically and improve effects, a multiscale mobile attention-based network, which we termed MANet, is proposed to perform the detection of pavement defects. The architecture of the encoder-decoder is used in MANet, where the encoder adopts the MobileNet as the backbone network to extract pavement defect features. Instead of the original 3 x 3 convolution, the multiscale convolution kernels are used in depthwise separable convolution (DSConv) layers of the network. Furthermore, the hybrid attention mechanism is separately incorporated into the encoder and decoder modules to infer the significance of spatial points and interchannel relationship features for the input intermediate feature maps. The proposed approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on two publicly available benchmark datasets, i.e., the Crack500 (500 crack images with 2000 x 1500 pixels) and CFD (118 crack images with 480 x 320 pixels) datasets. The mean intersection over union (MIoU) of the proposed approach on these two datasets reaches 0.7219 and 0.7788, respectively. Ablation experiments show that the multiscale convolution and hybrid attention modules can effectively help the model extract high-level feature representations and generate more accurate pavement crack segmentation results. We further test the model on locally collected pavement crack images (131 images with 1024 x 768 pixels) and it achieves a satisfactory result. The proposed approach realizes the MIoU of 0.6514 on the local dataset and outperforms other compared baseline methods.

In this study, we leverage the optimized YOLOv8 convolutional neural network to swiftly and precisely identify longitudinal cracks, transverse cracks, alligator cracks, potholes, and other road surface defects. The approach aims to reduce false detections and missed detections while enhancing both accuracy and speed of detection. We improve the neck structure of the YOLOv8s model by refining the BiFPN used in the EfficientDet model, thereby boosting overall model accuracy. Furthermore, we introduce a GAM global attention mechanism after the SPPF module of the YOLOv8 model to further enhance object detection precision. Experimental results demonstrate a 1% increase in mAP value after these improvements from 87.2% to 88.2%. This method outperforms the original YOLOv8 model approach and effectively identifies road defects with efficiency. PU  - IEEE PI  - NEW YORK PA  - 345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA},

abstract = {Pavement defects detection has made significant progress with the development of convolutional neural networks. Due to the topological complexity of pavement defects regions, most existing detection methods are limited to a limited number of types of defects, which results in unsatisfactory detection results for multi-classified defects. Several studies have used enhanced data to address this issue, however, few have considered the inefficiency caused by imbalanced differences between classes from the perspective of the network model itself. In light of this issue, our goal is to fill this gap by better exploring the fusion of different feature information to improve the performance of the network. As a result, we propose a multi-perspective feature collaborative perception learning network (MFCPLNet), which uses the model's contextual information to guide high-quality multi-classified defects detection and that can be adapted to various pavement conditions. Specifically, for adaptive feature extraction, an irregular perceptual extraction network (IPENet) with enhanced edge information is first designed to draw upon hybrid deformable convolution for efficient network block hybridization. Additionally, a multi-balanced collaborative learning mechanism (MCLM) consisting of auxiliary axial information and 3D feature guidance is constructed to enhance deep semantic features, improve the localization of defects in defective regions, and compensate for weak category supervision. Lastly, in the detection head, an iterative soft aggregation module has been designed to enhance scalable spatial interactions. The results of extensive testing were based on publicly available pavement defects datasets. Based on the proposed network, the mAP index reaches 29.6% and 33.8%, respectively, an increase of 8.3% and 4.6% over the baseline, which is qualitatively and quantitatively superior to mainstream methods.

abstract = {Regular pavement inspections are key to good road maintenance and detecting road defects. Advanced pavement inspection systems such as LCMS (Laser Crack Measurement System) can automatically detect the presence of simple defects (e.g. ruts) using 3D lasers. However, such systems still require manual involvement to complete the detection of more complex pavement defects (e.g. patches). This paper proposes an automatic patch detection system using object detection techniques. To our knowledge, this is the first time state-of-the-art object detection models (Faster RCNN, and SSD MobileNet-V2) have been used to detect patches inside images acquired by 3D profiling sensors. Results show that the object detection model can successfully detect patches inside such images and suggest that our proposed approach could be integrated into the existing pavement inspection systems. The contribution of this paper are (1) an automatic pavement patch detection model for images acquired by 3D profiling sensors and (2) comparative analysis of RCNN, and SSD MobileNet-V2 models for automatic patch detection.

abstract = {Pavement smoothness has become a standard measure of pavement quality. Transportation agencies strive to build and maintain smoother pavements. Road users generally perceive the quality of a pavement on the basis of how well it rides, which is severely affected by the presence of defects (bumps or dips) in the pavement profile. Defects are corrected according to the smoothness specifications prescribed by respective agencies. The effectiveness of any method used to identify defect locations depends on the decrease in roughness obtained on correction of the defects. Following this line of thought, this paper presents a method for the detection of defects based on a comparison of the original profile with a target or a desired profile. The proposed methodology is based on the international roughness index (IRI) gain function for the identification of defect locations to improve smoothness in pavements. This method uses the discrete Fourier transform to help identify defect locations on the basis of deviations of the original profile from the target or the smoothened profile. Areas with defects have a higher deviation from the smoothened profile than areas without defects. This method also estimates the contribution of each defect to roughness. Roughness statistics, such as the IRI and the present serviceability index, are used in the proposed approach to determine the severity of each defect. In addition, the use of a quarter-truck transfer function instead of the IRI gain function is demonstrated to illustrate consideration of dynamic load criteria for the detection of defects. The approach is illustrated through the use of profile data collected for in-service pavement sections.

abstract = {Pavement condition assessment is essential when developing road network maintenance programs. In practice, the data collection process is to a large extent automated. However, pavement distress detection (cracks, potholes, etc.) is mostly performed manually, which is labor-intensive and time-consuming. Existing methods either rely on complete 3D surface reconstruction, which comes along with high equipment and computation costs, or make use of acceleration data, which can only provide preliminary and rough condition surveys. In this paper we present a method for automated pothole detection in asphalt pavement images. In the proposed method an image is first segmented into defect and non-defect regions using histogram shape-based thresholding. Based on the geometric properties of a defect region the potential pothole shape is approximated utilizing morphological thinning and elliptic regression. Subsequently, the texture inside a potential defect shape is extracted and compared with the texture of the surrounding non-defect pavement in order to determine if the region of interest represents an actual pothole. This methodology has been implemented in a MATLAB prototype, trained and tested on 120 pavement images. The results show that this method can detect potholes in asphalt pavement images with reasonable accuracy. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

abstract = {In asphalt pavement detection, the defect scale changes greatly, mainly including mesh cracks, patches, and potholes. In the case of large scale, the texture feature is not clear, and the information is easily lost in the feature extraction process. Correspondingly, the number of small-scale holes is often very large, which also puts forward higher requirements for the detection model. In view of the above problems, this paper proposed a model for common asphalt pavement defects detection called YOLOv5-PD. In order to reduce the loss of information and expand the receptive field of the model, Big Kernel convolution was used to replace a part of the convolution in the original CSPDarknet. The texture feature information of the cracks is retained to the greatest extent. In order to enhance the detection performance of small defects, convolution channel attention mechanism was added after each feature fusion layer, and performs attention processing on the feature map after concat to find the defect location.

Radar systems have several major advantages, such as a high data acquisition rate and global monitoring through quasi-continuous measurements. Two radar techniques are tested for pavement structures. Impulse radar was the first technology used by the GPR community. In the 1990s, step-frequency technology enabled larger bandwidth and improved time resolution. The two radar techniques are now able to collect data at traffic speed. They record measurements along a longitudinal profile usually located in a wheel-path to provide Bscan records of the roadways pavement. It allows to detect layer interfaces and to estimate layer thickness and sometimes to detect internal defects such as sliding the interface. Since few years, new radar systems have been developed to record several longitudinal profiles and retrieve the 3D view of the pavement structure.

Nonetheless, due to traffic exposure and temperature stress, pavement markings may develop defects to diverse degrees. Consequently, the inspection and maintenance of pavement markings has been paid high attention. Traditional manual detection methods prove time-consuming, subjective, and present security risks. Therefore, we employed four object detection models [You Only Look Once version 5 (YOLOv5), YOLOv7, faster region convolutional neural networks (Faster R-CNN) with visual geometry group laboratory (VGG), and Faster R-CNN with residual network (ResNet)] to achieve intelligent recognition of pavement marking defects through deep learning. Each model underwent 1,000 epochs of training and utilized 2,000 annotated road inspection images. Through data augmentation, module optimization, and anchor redesign, these models can locate pavement markings and classify their defects. The accuracy and efficiency of the model were evaluated by mean average precision (mAP) and frames per second. In addition, we introduced evaluation indicators that focused on defect types to assist in selecting models with high applicability in detecting markings. Among these models, the optimized Faster R-CNN with VGG as the backbone network has an mAP of 93.96% and can detect over 28 images per second, which meets the engineering requirements.Pavement markings play a crucial role in guiding driver behavior, and they significantly contribute to alleviating traffic congestion and reducing traffic accidents. As the demand for autonomous driving technology increases, the maintenance of pavement markings has become more important. To address this, it is essential to determine which pavement markings require maintenance through inspection. However, traditional manual inspection methods suffer from issues such as low efficiency, high cost, and safety hazards. In this work, we developed four models utilizing artificial intelligence to automatically detect pavement markings in road inspection vehicle images.

Existing systems for automated pavement defect detection commonly require special devices such as lights, lasers, etc, which dramatically increase the cost and limit the system to certain applications. Therefore, in this paper, a low cost automatic pavement distress evaluation approach is proposed. This method can provide real-time pavement distress detection as well as evaluation results based on the color images captured from a camera installed on a survey vehicle. The entire process consists of two main parts: pavement surface extraction followed by pavement distress detection and classification. In the first part, a novel color segmentation method based on a feed forward neural network is applied to separate the road surface from the background. In the second part, a thresholding technique based on probabilistic relaxation is utilized to separate distresses from the road surface. Then, by inputting the geometrical parameters obtained from the detected distresses into a neural network based pavement distress classifier, the defects can be classified into different types. Simulation results are given to show that the proposed method is both effective and reliable on a variety of pavement images.

abstract = {Roadway pavement maintenance to the preferred level of serviceability comprises one of the most challenging problems faced by civil and transportation engineers, with regard to transport infrastructure management. This paper presents a study on the detection of roadway pavement anomalies by use of smartphone sensors and on-board diagnostic (OBD-II) devices, which can lead to low-cost roadway infrastructure assessment. The proposed approach, which, in addition to smartphone sensors, also utilizes artificial neural network (ANN) techniques in the analysis, captures a vehicle's interaction with a roadway pavement while the vehicle is moving, and utilizes the observed interaction patterns for the detection of potholes in the pavement. The method utilizes four metrics in the analysis and shows a detection accuracy of about 90%. Preliminary results on the inclusion of additional roadway defects in the analysis and on the ability of the method to distinguish between potholes and other pavement defects (e.g., patches, local upheavals, rutting, and corrugation) have been positive. The study's results confirm the value of smartphone sensors in the low-cost (and eventually crowdsourced) detection of potholes.

abstract = {Street defects, such as potholes and sunken manholes, in general develop quickly compared to other pavement distresses, such as cracking and rutting. Those street defects can result in vehicle damage. This paper proposes an automated and innovative method to obtain up-to-date information about those street defects with the use of a mobile data collection kit mounted on vehicles. In each mobile data collection kit, a triaxial accelerometer and global positioning system sensor collect data for the detection of street defects. A local algorithm is embedded in the mobile data collection kit to increase the efficiency of a local data logging process and to perform a preliminary detection of street defects. At a back-end server, a more precise street defect detection algorithm enhances the performance of the proposed monitoring system by integrating data collected from multiple sensor-equipped vehicles. The street defect detection algorithm at the back-end server relies on a supervised machine learning technique and a trajectory clustering algorithm. The framework of the data collection and integration is developed for the detection of isolated street defects and rough road conditions. The potential of detecting these conditions based on the dynamic responses of vehicles using machine learning techniques is investigated on real road conditions. The preliminary ratings for pavement distress are calculated by integrating the three classification results. Road networks that have isolated street defects and rough road surfaces are identified and visualized on an online map. The proposed system is of practical importance since it provides continuous information about road conditions, which can be valuable for pavement management systems and public safety.

abstract = {Deep learning techniques underpinned by extensive data sources encompassing complex pavement features have proven effective in early pavement damage detection. With pavement features exhibiting temperature variation, inexpensive infra-red imaging technology in combination with deep learning techniques can detect pavement damages effectively. Previous experiments based on pavement data captured during summer sunny conditions when subjected to SA-ResNet deep learning architecture technique demonstrated 96.47% prediction accuracy. This paper has extended the same deep learning approach to a different dataset comprised of images captured during winter sunny conditions to compare the prediction accuracy, sensitivity and recall score with summer conditions. The results suggest that irrespective of the prevalent weather season, the proposed deep learning algorithm categorises pavement features around 92% accurately (95.18% in summer and 91.67% in winter conditions), suggesting the beneficial replacement of one image type with other. The data captured in sunny conditions during summer and winter show prediction accuracies of DC = 96.47% > MSX = 95.24% > IR-T = 93.83% and DC = 94.14% > MSX = 90.69% > IR-T = 90.173%, respectively. DC images demonstrated a sensitivity of 96.47% and 94.20% for summer and winter conditions, respectively, to demonstrate that reliable categorisation is possible with deep learning techniques irrespective of the weather season. However, summer conditions showing better overall prediction accuracy than winter conditions suggests that inexpensive IR-T imaging cameras with medium resolution levels can still be an economical solution, unlike expensive alternate options, but their usage has to be limited to summer sunny conditions.

First, a fully convolutional network is designed to generate preliminary segmentation results, and a G-CRF is used to refine the segmentation.

The Genetic Algorithm (GA)-DenseNet is used to classify more than 6500 distress datasets to identify both two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) distresses. The input image size of the model is 224 * 224 pixels, and the recognition speed is 0.33 s per piece. Binocular stereo vision and point cloud processing are used for 3D reconstruction and extracting morphology features of potholes. The test results show that the average accuracy of depth and area is 98.9% and 98.0%, respectively. The RGB image is first used to calculate the pavement damage rate (DR) and pavement surface condition index (PCI) of road pothole defect in millimeter-level accuracy, and the overall detection accuracy is 88.2%. This study demonstrates a promising inexpensive way to automatically detect 3D pavement distresses, thereby providing direct guidance in pavement maintenance decision-making.

abstract = {The detection of pavement diseases is an important and basic link in the road maintenance process. Many methods based on deep learning have been applied. However, these methods are not accurate enough and cannot accurately identify defects in complex background with shadow occlusion and uneven lighting brightness. In order to overcome the shortcomings of previous detection methods, a complex background defect detection algorithm based on improved YOLOv7 is proposed. First, the K-means++ clustering algorithm is used for initial anchor box setting to obtain better anchor box parameters; then, the group spatial pyramid pooling module SPPCSPC_G is introduced to replace the original SPPCSPC module to improve the fusion speed of image features and thereby improve the detection accuracy; Finally, the GELU activation function is used as the activation function of the REPConv convolution module in the YOLOv7 model, which effectively reduces model overfitting and thereby improves model detection accuracy. The test results show that the average accuracy of the improved detection algorithm for disease detection increased from 65.4% to 72.3%, an increase of 6.9%, the amount of calculation and parameters decreased by 4% and 14.9% respectively, and the FPS reached 80, an increase of 17%, and no pavement defects are missed or wrongly detected. It is more suitable for real-time detection of defects in complex background. It can be seen that the improved YOLOv7 has better detection effect on complex background defects.

However, the difficult nature of pavement images, the small size of defects (cracks) lead to the fact that inspection in this area is done mostly manually.

abstract = {Pavements play a pivotal role in infrastructure construction, so pavement distress detection (PDD) will greatly affect pavement service life and vehicle operation safety. Traditional manual detection and computer detection methods have such disadvantages as low efficiency, high cost and error-proneness. Thus, they are not suitable for high-speed detection tasks due to a large number of defects. Defect detection methods based on deep learning can achieve end-to-end target detection, generalize and monitor targets in real time. On such a basis, this paper has proposed an efficient method of PDD based on improved YOLOv7. YOLOv7, which is the best-performing object detection model in the YOLO series, is known for its high efficiency, strong scalability, and support for panoramic detection. It lays a solid foundation for enhancing PDD models. In this paper, this model will be improved based on model speed and accuracy. Firstly, SimAM attention module is employed to weight feature images, which has greatly improved model accuracy. Secondly, Ghost module in place of a partial deep convolution module is used to improve model running speed. Then, SIoU, instead of the original localization loss function, is performed to optimize the model training process. Finally, the proposed improved YOLOv7 model is applied to different road defect datasets and compared with other methods, such as Faster R-CNN, CenterNet, DETR, YOLOv6 and the original YOLOv7 model. The results show that the proposed method has ubiquitous advantages over the above-mentioned methods, with the average mAP, F1 value and FPS value of 85.8%, 0.697 and 62.13 fps respectively.

The Deformable Large Kernel Attention (DLKA) mechanism adjusts convolution kernels dynamically, adapting to multi-scale targets. The Large Separable Kernel Attention (LSKA) enhances the SPPF feature extractor, boosting multi-scale feature extraction capabilities.

abstract = {Knowing the pavement condition is essential for efficiently deciding on maintenance programs. Current practice is predominantly manual with only 0.4% of inspections happening automatically. All methods in the literature aiming at automating condition assessment focus on two defects at most, or are too expensive for practical application. In this paper, the authors propose a low-cost method that automatically detects pavement defects simultaneously using parking camera video data. The types of defects addressed in this paper are two types of cracks (longitudinal and transverse), patches, and potholes. The method uses the semantic texton forests (STFs) algorithm as a supervised classifier on a calibrated region of interest (myROI), which is the area of the video frame depicting only the usable part of the pavement lane. It is validated using data collected from the local streets of Cambridge, U.K. Based on the results of multiple experiments, the overall accuracy of the method is above 82%, with a precision of more than 91% for longitudinal cracks, more than 81% for transverse cracks, more than 88% for patches, and more than 76% for potholes. The duration for training and classifying spans from 25 to 150min, depending on the number of video frames used for each experiment.

abstract = {Timely and accurately detection as well as rehabilitation of road surface defects are of utmost importance for ensuring road safety and minimizing maintenance cost. However, the variety of pavement distress types and forms makes it difficult to accurately classify and detect them. To tackle the issue, this paper proposes a novel target detection model YOLO-SST based on YOLOv5 with the improvement in pavement distress features. First, a Shuffle Attention mechanism is introduced in the feature extraction backbone network to enhance the detection ability without significantly increasing the computational cost. Secondly, we add a detection layer and embed Swin-Transformer encoder blocks into the C3 module to capture global and contextual information. Finally, to improve the model's detection ability, transfer learning is employed on a self-made dataset called RDDdect_2023, which consists of street view images captured via a DJI Action camera mounted on the car. Experimental results demonstrate that the YOLO-SST model outperforms YOLOv5 and other target detection models in terms of accuracy, recall rate, and mAP@0.5 value for detecting pavement distresses. This confirms that the YOLO-SST model has stronger feature extraction and fusion capabilities, resulting in better detection performance.

Current detection models fail to balance accuracy and speed. In this study, we propose a fast damage detection algorithm named FPDDN to achieve real-time and high-accuracy pavement damage detection. FPDDN integrates the deformable transformer, D2f block, and SFB module to predict pavement damage of different sizes in multiple branches. The deformable transformer allows the FPDDN to exhibit adaptability to geometric variations in road defects, thereby improving the detection accuracy of irregular defects such as cracks. D2f block is mainly used to lightweight the network and increase the inference speed. The SFB module can significantly decrease the loss of information during downsampling of small-sized objects. This integration enhances the model's ability to extract global damage features, reduces the loss of information on small-scale defects, and improves the synergy between deep and shallow feature layers. The model's performance was evaluated using the RDD2022 dataset, focusing on inference speed and detection accuracy. When compared to state-of-the-art models such as YOLO v8, FPDDN has a parameter count that is only one-fifth of that of YOLO v8x, yet it surpasses YOLO v8x in detection accuracy.

However, the detection of pavement defects remains a great challenge owing to many difficulties, for example, complex backgrounds, microdefects, various defect shapes and sizes, class imbalance issues, etc. Recently, deep learning has demonstrated its superior performance on pixelwise image segmentation, but some issues still exist on demanding pixelwise image segmentation, for instance, limited receptive field, insufficiency processing of local features, information loss issue generated by pooling operations, etc. Based on all of the above issues, a multiscale triple-attention network, named MST-Net, is proposed for end-to-end pixelwise crack detection. First, a multiscale input strategy is applied to the proposed segmentation network to capture more context information. Meanwhile, it can capably reduce the effect of the information loss issue generated by pooling operations. Second, to realize effective feature representation of local features, an additive attention fusion (AAF) block is proposed to guide feature learning to capture both global and local contexts. In addition, faced with the crack detection task with class imbalance issues, a triple attention (TA) block is proposed to detect spatial, channel and pixel attention information to suppress the background and useless information, which is conducive to the characterization of microcracks. Finally, aiming at the limited receptive field, a multiscale feature aggregation unit is proposed for feature fusion to increase the detection ability of multiscale defects. To better guide network training, a deep supervision mechanism is also introduced to speed up the convergence of the proposed segmentation model and improve the performance of defect segmentation. The related evaluation and detection experiments are carried out on three public datasets on crack segmentation, and the comparison experiments with the mainstream segmentation models show that the proposed segmentation network achieves excellent performance on pixelwise crack detection.

abstract = {The paper discusses an approach to detecting and classifying pavement defects in images of road sections obtained from photographs and video frames in the process of road scanning. A modern way to reduce the risks of road incidents is to implement technologies for monitoring and analyzing various factors in order to assess their impact on accident rates. One of the factors is pavement defects, which deteriorate the performance of roads and become the causes of road incidents and vehicle damage. The aim of the study is to recognize roadway defects based on their degree of contrast compared to defect-free sections. The main problems are the accuracy of recognizing and classifying defects under conditions of noise associated with weather conditions and lighting, as well as the inaccuracy of determining their geometric dimensions from two-dimensional images. To solve the problems of detection, recognition and classification of pavement defects with acceptable accuracy in image processing with noise, we developed an approach that includes two methods: a) a method using IoU-HOG-ACM-BoVW algorithms for recognition and classification of high noise images, b) a method of segmentation and recognition using convolutional neural network MaskR-CNN for recognition and classification of low noise images. The algorithms for solving the problems of segmenting road pavement images into parts with detected damages, determining the boundaries and geometric dimensions of defects, classifying damages by type, clustering and ranking road segments according to the operational condition of the road pavement to reduce accidents, improve traffic safety and planning repair work on highways are considered. The proposed approach includes two methods: the first is a method for estimating road segments based on their clustering using the DBSCAN algorithm, taking into account noise and the distribution density of similar segments on a digital map. The method identifies clusters of dangerous road segments and ranks them according to the operational condition of the road surface. The approach increases the level of road safety and allows efficient allocation of resources for repair and preventive works. The paper discusses a methodology for assessing road safety in selected clusters of road sections. A noise-aware clustering algorithm can identify the distribution densities of similar sections with different defects, identify patterns of their occurrence, detect anomalies, and provide decision-making for repair planning. Imagine a scenario where accidents and maintenance costs can be reduced by identifying problem road sections in advance. #CSOC1120.

U-Net is implemented in the pixelwise segmentation for object and defect detection using multiple feature images. This method was validated on four applications, including on-site path detection, pavement cracking detection, highway slope detection, and building facade window detection.

Climatic factors are unavoidable and can affect the properties of asphalt mixtures, making them weaker and less durable. Thus, continuous monitoring of bituminous surfaces is something that can reduce the risks of public health. Remote sensing techniques have become an effective, noninvasive method for early detection of damaged asphalt pavements. This paper outlines a range of different remote sensing methodologies that can be used to monitor asphalt road pavements. This is complemented by the use of field spectroscopy for the examination of asphalt pavements of varying age and conditions. The results of the study found spectral differences regarding asphalt defects, such as physical cracking, patched cracking and polishing. These spectral changes were examined through "in-band" simulation analysis of the Landsat 7 ETM+ sensor, using appropriate relative spectral response filters, concluding that the ratio band 5/band 1 can be used to distinguish asphalt pavements of different date of construction and condition.

Pavement cracks, which expedite surface degradation, pose substantial threats to road longevity and vehicular stability, thereby highlighting the critical importance of precise detection of pavement distress images for automated road maintenance. Accurate detection not only mitigates maintenance costs but also fortifies road safety and optimizes repair operations. In contrast to traditional fully-supervised semantic segmentation algorithms, which rely heavily on extensive annotated data and neglect model prediction uncertainty, we introduce a novel Attention-Neural Process Network (ANP-Net). This attention-based semi-supervised semantic segmentation framework seamlessly integrates neural processes with attention mechanisms, presenting a robust solution for pavement defect detection. ANP-Net leverages attention-enhanced neural processes to mimic random processes through finite-dimensional marginal distributions, enabling probabilistic modeling of encoded features. It introduces a novel semi-supervised contrastive loss based on low-confidence predictions, categorizing pseudo-labeled pixels according to their entropy values and computing contrastive losses accordingly. To transcend the limitations of teacher-student networks that solely rely on loss functions and weight smoothing for interaction, ANP-Net innovatively employs a dual-path cross-attention mechanism, fostering more effective information exchange between the two networks PU  - TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD PI  - ABINGDON PA  - 2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND},

abstract = {Road quality assessment is a key task in a city's duties as it allows a city to operate more efficiently. This assessment means a city's budget can be allocated appropriately to make sure the city makes the most of its usually limited budget. However, this assessment still relies largely on manual annotation to generate the Overall Condition Index (OCI) of a pavement stretch. Manual surveying can be inaccurate, while on the other side of the spectrum a large portion of automatic surveying techniques rely on expensive equipment (such as laser line scanners). To solve this problem, we propose an automated infrastructure assessment method that relies on street view images for its input and uses a spectrum of computer vision and pattern recognition methods to generate its assessments. We first segment the pavement surface in the natural image. After this, we operate under the assumption that only the road pavement remains, and utilize a sliding window approach using Fisher Vector encoding to detect the defects in that pavement; with labelled data, we would also be able to classify the defect type (longitudinal crack, transverse crack, alligator crack, pothole ... etc.) at this stage. A weighed contour map within these distressed regions can be used to identify exact crack and defect locations. Combining this information allows us to determine severities and locations of individual defects in the image. We use a manually annotated dataset of Google Street View images in Hamilton, Ontario, Canada. We show promising results, achieving a 93% F1-measure on crack region detection from perspective images.

abstract = {Subsurface consolidation defect is a common issue in concrete pavement construction, and the hidden defects often require costly repairs after project delivery. Therefore, being able to identify this type of defect during construction will enable contractor to conduct quick repairs to avoid costly post construction rework. In this paper a semi real-time detection approach using infrared thermography is introduced. The developed approach utilizes the hydration heat during curing time to identify the subsurface voids based on the regional temperature contrast. Experimental studies were conducted using artificial void-defect in different sizes and depths. The thermographic analysis is employed to locate the void-defects during the first 12 h of curing time. Two field experiments were conducted to validate the proposed approach. The outcomes show that the defects could be identified and located within certain time windows during the curing process, even under adversary outdoor environmental conditions. In conclusion, infrared thermography can be used as a feasible and reliable non-destructive-detection method to conduct real-time or semi real-time monitoring of subsurface defects during concrete pavement construction. The influential environmental factors, practical considerations, and the future study are also discussed. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

In this paper, a new pavement defect detection system based on Image Processing was developed which utilized Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) to avoid blocking the traffic flow and to enlarge monitoring range. It was divided into two subsystems: UAV intelligent control modulus and defect detection modulus. For the former, special programs were designed to achieve the functions such as automatically taking off and landing, automatically trajectory control, and camera and gimbal control. For the latter, based on the comparative analysis of the basic principles and multiple image groups experiments of normal edge detection algorithms, a combined method was proposed. This proposed method can not only automatically provide the high threshold that Canny algorithm needs to input manually, but also solve the lack of edge detection ability in OTSU segmentation algorithm. The efficiency and accuracy of the image processing is verified through the experiments. It is also showed that the weak edges in the image can be better retained by taking 1/3 to 1/2 of the high threshold as a low threshold in this combined method.

abstract = {In general, potholes on asphalt pavements can be detected and represented in 2D and 3D. However, pothole detections through 3D imaging and image reconstructions have proven to be expensive in terms of acquisition equipment and the computational and processing requirements and time. For potholes at incipient formations, their detection, representation and quantification in terms of the surface-area are important for timely maintenance and repairs. By casting pavement image segmentation for pothole detection as a problem of clustering multivariate features within mixed pixels (mixels), this study presents a low-cost 2D vision image-based approach for the detection of potholes on asphalt road pavements in urban areas. The approach in this study is based on the a priori integration of multiscale texture-based image filtering for textons representation using wavelet transform, into the superpixel clustering of the pavement defects and non-defects using fuzzy c-means (FCM) algorithm. For the extraction of the defects extrema (minima and maxima) in the hybrid wavelet-FCM clustering results, fine segmentation based on morphological reconstruction is adopted to further smoothen and recognize the contour of the detected potholes. The methodology is implemented in a MATLAB prototype, tested and validated using 75 experimental image datasets. With a mean CPU run-time of 95 seconds, the average detection accuracies by comparing the study results and the manually segmented ground-truth data were determined using the Dice coefficient of similarity, Jaccard Index and sensitivity metric as 87.5%, 77.7% and 97.6% respectively. The average magnitudes of the mean and standard deviation of the percentage errors in pothole size extractions were detected as 8.5% and 4.9% respectively.

Second, we replace the neck of YOLOv8 with the neck of the ASF-YOLO network to fully integrate spatial and scale features, improving multiscale feature extraction capability.

Furthermore, we utilize Wise-IoU (WIoU) to optimize the model's loss function, which accounts for the quality factors of objects more effectively, enabling adaptive learning adjustments based on samples of varying qualities. Our model was evaluated on the RDD2022 road damage dataset, demonstrating significant improvements over the baseline model.

abstract = {Sinkholes form when culverts beneath roadways fail, posing a safety hazard that requires costly repairs and causes traffic delays. Detecting the onset of sub-pavement voids can prevent sudden pavement failure. This research presents an automated approach for increasing the detection accuracy of sub-pavement voids from infrared (IR) images collected with an unmanned aerial vehicle. A framework is developed that relies on i) principal component thermography analysis to increase accuracy of the damage detection and ii) the EfficientDet algorithm to automate the inspection process. Field tests on a roadway demonstrated the capabilities of the proposed framework in detecting sub-pavements voids with accuracy comparable to ground penetrating radar while significantly reducing the inspection time. The automated detection method yielded a mean average precision of 0.85 when detecting both visible and sub-pavement defects, outperforming other deep learning algorithms by 24%.

Regular and routine monitoring provide clear information on road conditions and the level of damage to pavement surfaces. In this study, a vibration-based method was used as a monitoring technique to evaluate the pavement surface conditions on local roads. Pre-processing techniques were used to cancel noise and prepare the data for feature extraction and prediction. Two multiclassification Machine Learning (ML) models were used, including Random Forest (RF) and Decision Tree (DT), for the automated classification and detection of different types of pavement distresses. In addition, a Support Vector Machine (SVM) technique was used to develop a binary ML model for the same classification and detection purposes. The results showed that the developed ML models provide high accuracy in predicting the road degradation classification with about 93% accuracy using the RF and 90% accuracy using the DT. Using the SVM model, the overall average accuracy of detection and classification of pavement defects was about 96%. & COPY; 2022 Tongji University and Tongji University Press.

abstract = {Pavement markings on roads and highways are used to guide the roadway users. They play an essential role in promoting efficient use of the roadway and drivers' safety. Typically, pavement markings deteriorate at a higher rate and last between 0.5 and 3 years. Because of the short lifecycle, pavement markings require frequent inspection and maintenance. Traditionally, pavement markings have been assessed periodically by road inspectors. This manual method is time-consuming, subjective, and exposes the road inspectors to high safety risks. Therefore, this paper presents a deep learning framework for automated pavement marking defects identification. The proposed framework uses a photogrammetry data set collected from Google Maps. Images of pavement markings are processed by annotating the marking defects. A deep learning algorithm called faster region convolutional neural networks (R-CNN) has been utilized to identify the pavement marking defects. The proposed model went through three iterations of training and used 1,040 annotated images. In the final stage, the model was tested using 60 images and was run for 46,194 epochs. The model was able to identify the pavement marking defects with a confidence level ranging from 43% to 99%. The model result was validated visually by inspecting the condition of the road markings used in testing the model. The proposed automated process is capable of generating a summary report of the condition of pavement markings that can enhance the current practices.

abstract = {Cracks are among the most commonly found road surface degradations, requiring periodical road surveys for monitoring pavement quality. Images of road pavement surface can be automatically processed, typically employing segmentation algorithms to identify cracks. However, a set of distinct connected components often result, leading to the detection of several independent crack segments, although they may belong to the same pavement surface defect. This is often observed for cracks that exhibit a longer linear development or present several branches. This paper presents a new strategy to identify cracks on images captured during road pavement surveys, even when those cracks appear with a complex shape. The proposed crack segmentation algorithm includes two stages: (i) selection of prominent "crack seeds", adopting an efficient segmentation procedure, after appropriate image smoothing, minimizing the detection of false positives; (ii) iterative binary pixel classification, into the crack or non-crack classes, extending the "seeds" to identify the complete crack shape. The paper also tests the combination of the proposed two stage crack segmentation with three smoothing techniques, to evaluate their suitability for crack detection. As a final step the system classifies the identified cracks as longitudinal, transversal or miscellaneous types. Tests performed with images acquired from different types of sensors (active and non-active), show improved crack segmentation results.

Duplicate collections for the same distress and multiple overlaps of defects are both practical problems that greatly affect the detection results. In this paper, we propose a fine-grained feature-matching and image-stitching method for pavement distress detection to eliminate duplications and visually demonstrates local pavement distress. The original images are processed through a hierarchical structure, including rough data filtering, feature matching, and image stitching. The original data are firstly filtered based on the global position system (GPS) information, which can avoid full-dataset comparison and improve the calculating efficiency. A scale-invariant feature transform is introduced for feature matching based on the extracted key regions using spectral saliency mapping and bounding boxes. Two parameters: the mean Euclidean distance (MEuD) and the matching rate (MCR) are constructed to identify the duplication between two images. A support vector machine is then applied to determine the threshold of MEuD and MCR. This paper further discusses the correlation between the sampling frequency and the number of detection vehicles. The method provided can effectively solve the problem of duplications in pavement distress detection and enhances the feasibility of multivehicle pavement distress detection based on images.

abstract = {Pavement management systems rely on comprehensive up-to-date road condition data to provide effective decision support for short, medium and long term maintenance scheduling. However, the cost per mile of the existing condition data collection methods allows only for periodical surveys. This leads to long gaps between inspections and a focus on major roads over rural ones. Therefore, pavement condition monitoring systems that provide inexpensive frequent updates on the road condition are necessary. Such systems would require robust and automatic defect detection methods using low-cost sensors. In this paper, one such method is proposed for detecting road patches from video data acquired by the car's parking camera. A patch is initially detected based on its visual characteristics, which are: 1) it consists of a closed contour and 2) its texture is the same with the surrounding intact pavement. The patch is then passed to a kernel tracker in order to trace it in subsequent video frames. This way redetection is avoided and each patch is reported only once. The method was implemented in a C# prototype and tested with video data consisting of approximately 4000 frames collected from roads in Cambridge, UK. The results show that the suggested method has 84% precision and 96% recall. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

abstract = {Road networks are created with different pavement designs. In general, flexible pavement is preferred as the most used superstructure type in the world. Road networks with this superstructure experience deterioration for some reasons. These deteriorations take different forms over time and create road defects. The process of identifying defects is very important for the efficiency of the road pavement and traffic components. In this study, the process of automatic detection and classification of road defects occurring in flexible superstructure road networks was carried out with an intelligent system. Road images obtained from eight different countries and 10 different road defects were taken into consideration in the study. YOLOv5 object detection model was used in the detection process of defects. The training processes were completed by creating five different variants and different combinations and YOLOv5l provided the best performance. mAP and F1 Score values were determined as 0.526 and 0.540, respectively. In addition, a global-scale automatic road defect detection system has been developed via new data set consisting of different countries. The developed system is a prototype and has the ability to detect and classify defects occurring in road networks in real-time. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to detect the most road defect classes in real time. The created system was tested on a 4.5 km long university campus network as a case study.

It is clear that the system will be a guide for road network managers by obtaining location information of the identified defects. Detecting, classifying and locating road defects with the developed system will accelerate the maintenance and repair process of road networks and also extend their service life.

This paper proposes a pavement distress recognition method based on road quality detection equipment and deep learning. Firstly, the sub-block image is used as the processing unit, and the three-dimensional image is divided into fracture surface element and background surface element. A pavement crack recognition network (PDRNet) based on convolutional neural network is proposed, which is used for automatic recognition of pavement background element and pavement crack element. Then, considering the pixel-level neighborhood characteristics of cracks in 3D pavement images, the PDRNet model is used to detect and quantitatively evaluate pavement cracks, which combines the crack elevation detection method to extract the complete contour of cracks in the crack surface element. Finally, the distress database containing three-dimensional markers is integrated into the pavement maintenance management platform. Results show that the PDRNet proposed in this paper has high prediction accuracy on the verification set and shows good robustness to various distress, and the average accuracy is above 88%. The established spatial-temporal integration platform overcomes the communication bottleneck between different types of data, and is important to improve the maintenance management level and predict the long-term development of distress.

Although ground penetrating radar (GPR) methods have been widely used in non-destructive detection of pavements, the thickness estimation of the thin top surface layer is still a difficult problem due to the limitations of GPR resolution and the similar permittivity of asphalt sub-layers. Besides, the detection of some road defects, including inadequate compaction and delamination at interfaces, require further practical study. In this paper, a newly-developed vehicle-mounted GPR detection system is introduced. We used a horizontal high-pass filter and a modified layer localization method to extract the underground layers. Besides, according to lab experiments and simulation analysis, we proposed theoretical methods for detecting the degree of compaction and delamination at the interface, respectively.

The knowledge discovered by mining the crack data can be used to avoid subjective crack feature selection for vision-based pavement evaluation systems. Moreover, the statistical evaluation of crack features can be used as fundamental data to justify pavement rehabilitation policies. For this purpose, surface images of flexible pavements in different deterioration stages were analyzed using a novel image-processing technique. Seven imagery features of the detected objects including area, length, width, orientation, intensity, texture roughness, and wheel-path position, which are commonly used in pavement applications, were extracted and analyzed. A comprehensive statistical analysis was performed using filter feature subset selection (FSS) methods to rank crack features based on their significance (relevance and redundancy) for the pavement crack-detection problem. Based on the results, length, intensity, and wheel-path position were identified as the optimal feature-set for the vision-based system. Statistical characteristics of crack features were also analyzed to extract accurate quantitative measures for pavement conditions assessment. The statistical characterization identified longitudinal cracks within the wheel path as the dominant defect of the validation data set.

abstract = {A three-dimensional ground-penetrating radar (GPR) captures non-destructively internal pavement distress characteristics. However, interpreting radar images and data analysis pose challenges. To improve the accuracy of distress identification, a three-dimensional digital model of internal pavement distress was established. Firstly, initial electromagnetic signal data were pre-processed to effectively eliminate spurious signals and enhance distress characteristic signals. The distress was located, and GPR images of typical distress were extracted and summarised. Next, the 3D dataset was constructed based on the pre-processed electromagnetic echo signals. A 3D digital model of internal pavement distress was generated using the inverse distance weight and ray-casting methods with trilinear interpolation. Finally, relying on the physical project, cores were extracted to validate the distress model. The method effectively reflects the internal pavement distress, and enables realise the interactive images between the pavement entity and the digital model, which can essentially contribute to the digital twin of pavement systems.

While advanced 3D laser profiling systems have the capability to automatically identify certain types of distress such as cracks and ruts, more complex pavement damage, including patches, often require manual identification. To address this limitation, this study proposes an automated patch detection system that employs object detection techniques. The results demonstrate the ability of object detection models to accurately identify patches in laser profiling images, indicating that the proposed approach has the capability to significantly enhance automation in visual inspection processes.

Relying on inefficient manual pavement detection methods is difficult to meet the needs of large-scale detection. To tackle this issue, experiments were conducted to explore deep learning -based intelligent identification models, leveraging pavement distress data as the fundamental basis. The dataset encompasses pavement micro cracks, which hold particular significance for the purpose of pavement preventive maintenance.

This method achieves comparable detection performance (mAP: 0.93) to that of two -stage detectors, while exhibiting only a minimal increase in the number parameters. Overall, the two -stage model demonstrated excellent detection performance when using residual network (ResNet) as the backbone, whereas the YOLO algorithm of the one -stage detection model proved to be more suitable for practical engineering applications.

To address this problem, this paper presents a method for combining the you only look once (YOLO) series with 3D ground-penetrating radar (GPR) images to recognize the internal defects in asphalt pavement and compares the effectiveness of traditional detection and GPR detection by evaluating the maintenance benefits. First, traditional detection is conducted to survey and summarize the surface conditions of tested roads, which are missing the internal information. Therefore, GPR detection is implemented to acquire the images of concealed defects. Then, the YOLOv5 model with the most even performance of the six selected models is applied to achieve the rapid identification of road defects. Finally, the benefits evaluation of maintenance programs based on these two detection methods is conducted from economic and environmental perspectives. The results demonstrate that the economic scores are improved and the maintenance cost is reduced by $49,398/km based on GPR detection; the energy consumption and carbon emissions are reduced by 792,106 MJ/km (16.94%) and 56,289 kg/km (16.91%), respectively, all of which indicates the effectiveness of 3D GPR in pavement detection and maintenance.

abstract = {Automatic pavement defect segmentation is a big challenge because of the class diversity and extremely random distribution of defects. Most existing approaches focus on supervised strategies to achieve decent performance. Due to the difficulty of getting massive densely annotated samples and the limited prior knowledge of potential defects, these methods have significant bottlenecks in the actual pavement settings. This paper proposes a relevance-aware and cross-reasoning network (RCN) for anomaly segmentation of pavement defects, which can segment defects using merely non-defective images for training. A relevance-aware transformer-based encoder is first devised to model intrinsic interdependencies across local features, thus improving representations of complex non-defective images. Next, a dual decoder strategy is proposed to remap the encoder-generated latent dependencies at the local semantic and global detailed levels, respectively. Specifically, a cross-reasoning refinement module is built in the local decoder to reason the cross-relationship between spatial and channel dimensions. Finally, a context-aware abnormal distillation measurement is developed to evaluate the semantic reconstruction deviations during the inference. Under the guidance of semantic affinity, this measurement allows our model to highlight defective areas adaptively. Extensive experimental results on four datasets indicate that RCN outperforms other leading anomaly segmentation methods.

The optimized contextual information and features of shallower layers are gradually merged into three resolutions. Subsequently, the hierarchical feature fusion refinement module and the boundary refinement module are applied to each branch. These two modules effectively promote the seamless fusion of features at various scales and make the model pay more attention to boundaries.

abstract = {Conventional testing practices in pavement damage surveillance and maintenance such as coring tend to be slow, destructive in nature and not wholly representative of the entire stretch of the pavement. Newly emerging technologies based on non-destructive testing techniques, do not demand implementing destructive measures or relying on extrapolation of point data and can be implemented after developing them into a proper technique and a set testing protocol. One such emerging technique that uses infrared emissions from any structure to inspect underlying defects is infrared thermography (IRT). In a patch of pavement containing subsurface defects, the heat flow to the surface of the pavement, which itself depends on the incident solar radiation, ambient temperature and other meteorological factors, gets disrupted causing a difference in the thermal signature of the defective and the sound patches. This difference in thermal signature can potentially be detected by a thermal imaging camera. This study aims at exploring the potential of IRT technique to assess the subsurface debonding defect in asphalt pavements. For this purpose, an in situ asphalt pavement test section has been constructed and different interlayer bonding conditions have been artificially induced in it. A novel way for quantitative and qualitative analyses of thermal signatures, using MATLAB for each of these bonding conditions has been carried out. The effect of different debonding agents on the overall thermal behavior of asphalt pavement has also been evaluated. Interchange time duration between day heating and night cooling cycles has been estimated, to determine the suitable time duration for asphalt pavement inspection. The results, advantages, and limitations of the method have been presented. PU  - SPRINGER HEIDELBERG PI  - HEIDELBERG PA  - TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY},

First, PCGAN is used to generate realistic crack images, to address the problem of the small number of available images. Next, YOLO-MF is developed based on an improved YOLO v3 modified by an acceleration algorithm and median flow (MF) algorithm to count the number of cracks.

Therefore, cost-effective ways must be suggested, in order to see how badly deteriorated the investigated structure is. One of these cost-effective ways is the infrared thermography technique.

abstract = {Subgrade defects originate below the base of an asphalt pavement and they contribute significantly to pavement damage. The detection of subgrade defects is considered challenging because the recognition of defects is difficult. Therefore, the utilization of ground penetrating radar (GPR) to detect subgrade defects has attracted significant interest in recent years. However, the use of manually processed GPR images for classifying defects is inefficient and inaccurate. Thus, in this study, we applied convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to GPR images for automatically classifying subgrade defects (e.g., uneven settlement, sinkholes, and subgrade cracks). Two CNNs called multi-stage CNN and cascade CNN with different structures were established to accomplish the tasks automatically. The main difference between the two CNNs is that the cascade CNN is a classifier 2, which is for recognition and trained only using hard samples. Each CNN was developed in training, validation, and testing processes. Based on the training and testing results, sensitivity analysis was performed to verify the stability of the CNNs. We compared state-of-the-art methods for defect detection and the CNN-based method in order to verify the superior performance of the CNNs. Finally, we tested an application of the CNN-based method to show that it is transferrable to other asphalt pavements. The training results indicated that the cascade CNN classified subgrade defects with 97.35% accuracy during training and 96.80% in validation, while the multi-stage CNN classified subgrade defects with 91.35% accuracy during training and 90.45% in validation. The sensitivity analysis results showed that the cascade CNN exhibited the expected stability in terms of the transmitting frequency, i.e., the frequency of a high-frequency electromagnet wave from the transmitting antenna of the GPR, and different highway structures, whereas the multi-stage CNN did not. In addition, compared with Sobel edge detection and K-value clustering analysis, the CNN-based method obtained more robust performance at subgrade defect detection under various conditions using raw images. These results indicate that the CNN-based method performs well and it can classify subgrade defects in realistic situations. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The approach was based on three stages: pre-processing, feature extraction and classification. In pre-processing, we carried out several algorithms to compensate the impact of quality distortions during image acquisition. Then, features are retrieved from projective integrals computed on edge images. These features fed machine learning algorithms to classify the type of crack that may appear in a pavement image. The obtained results proved the relevance of our reduced features. We achieved the best successful classification rate of 93.4% using the Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier and an accuracy of 94.7% for crack detection.

abstract = {Flushing is a pavement surface defect that affects the structural integrity of thin-sprayed seal (chip seal) surfacings. Analysis was carried out on pavement performance data to determine the combination of factors that provides the best indication of flushing occurrence on in-service pavements. Data were sourced from the Long-Term Pavement Performance (LTPP) programme in New Zealand as well as from field testing. The LTPP data were analysed in four categories; pavement composition characteristics: traffic-related factors, climatic factors, and effects of other pavement defects. Factor and correlation analyses were used to determine and investigate the factors that showed significant relationships to flushing. Surface thickness, surface age, surfacing type, and rutting were found to have statistically significant correlations to flushing. Field testing provided data relating to the soil moisture environment under the pavement. The dry density and water content of soil were identified as having significant correlations to flushing. Regression analysis of the combination of these factors yielded a robust model to identify flushing. DOI: 10.1061/(ASCE)TE.1943-5436.0000354. (C) 2012 American Society of Civil Engineers.

abstract = {Pavement crack detection is an essential defect inspection task to ensure traffic and driving safety. Despite the recent studies that have achieved promising performance for inspecting pavement cracks, they still suffer from the challenges of background complexity, crack diversity, and generalization ability. To address these problems, we propose a contrastive decoupling network (CDNet) for detecting pavement cracks. Specifically, this contrastive decoupling framework separately extracts the global and local features with contrastive learning. It can effectively boost the discriminative power and generalization ability of the feature representations. Moreover, we propose a global semantic enhancement (GSE) module to enhance the semantic information of the global features. This module can reinforce the distinguishability for accurately identifying cracks and backgrounds. Furthermore, we propose a local detail refinement (LDR) module to refine the detailed information of the local features. This module can strengthen the localizability for detecting cracks with precise shapes. In addition, we propose a dynamic dependency -aware feature aggregation (DDFA) scheme to adaptively integrate the global and local features based on contextual dependencies. This scheme can enrich the output features for effectively detecting cracks in each image. Experimental results on four pavement crack detection datasets, namely Crack500, CrackTree200, CFD, and AEL, demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.

abstract = {The pavement surface will inevitably develop cracks, subsidence, pits, ruts, and other defects due to the effects of traffic and the environment. In road engineering, vibration-based pavement condition monitoring has been widely adopted. Due to differences in vehicle dynamics, acquisition equipment, and road quality, the application of these techniques to the identification of minor pavement damage is limited. With the widespread adoption of the inertial navigation system (INS) in autonomous vehicles, INS-based pavement evaluation has emerged as a promising new technique. In this paper, the acceleration sensor, gyroscope, GPS, and other INS-integrated devices were used to collect data on vehicle attitude changes. For the detection of pavement apparent millimetre disease, a new method utilising INS data and machine learning was proposed. The method analyses the original vibration signal in time domain, determines the degree of sensing parameter influence, and extracts the index that can characterise the signal change. Multiple machine learning recognition models have been built to effectively classify road conditions, with the best-performing model achieving an F1 score of 99.61% and precision of 99.33%. The recall rate, accuracy rate, and F1 score of disease height classification were all above 0.7 on a macro and micro scale.

The performance of RGB-D sensors in pavement condition data collection has not received enough attention. By providing a thorough literature review on the specification of RGB-D sensors, this paper aims to assess and compare the performance of two RGB-D sensors in pavement condition data collection. First, by collecting data from asphalt, concrete, and mosaic surfaces in wet and dry conditions, the accuracy and precision of the sensors are evaluated. For this purpose, noise reduction techniques are applied to the central region of interest and the inherent trend of depth frames is corrected by implementing the Singular Value Decomposition algorithm. Second, dimensions of artificial objects above the pavement surface are detected via sensors by using the Lease Square Method (LSM) and edge detection techniques to evaluate RGB-D sensors' ability and performance in measurement of artificial pavement defects of known dimensions. The results of statistical analysis show the difference in error measurement via both sensors in all surfaces in wet and dry conditions. Through conducting extensive field experiments, it is concluded that Kinect one has several advantages over the Kinect Xbox 360 in pavement condition data collection.

abstract = {Crack is a common disease of pavement, which will lead to more serious problems if it is not found and maintained in time. This means that it is very important to accurately extract and measure the damage information of pavement cracks. Compared with the traditional methods, the automatic detection and segmentation of pavement cracks using visual elements are more effective which has become a focused area. Although extensive researches has used deep learning methods in pavement crack detection, these methods only involve the single task of detection or segmentation, and few research optimises and combines them. In addition, the accuracy and inference speed of pavement crack detection and segmentation algorithm is also worthy of further research. To solve these limitations, this research proposes a new method of two-stage pavement crack detection and segmentation based on deep learning. The proposed method combines pavement crack detection and segmentation. In the first stage, the optimised YOLOv4 is used as the pavement crack damage detection algorithm to detect pavement cracks under various complex backgrounds. In the second stage, the cracks detected in the first stage are segmented, the detection accuracy is specific to the damage pixels. To further optimise the performance of the detection and segmentation algorithm, a new deeplabv3+ pavement crack segmentation method based on the Ghost module and CRAM attention mechanism is proposed. Compared with the original network, the proposed two-stage pavement damage detection and segmentation method improve the detection accuracy by 2.23% and 7.47%, respectively. The network inference speed is improved by 35.3% and 50.3%, respectively. Compared with the existing single-stage pavement damage detection or segmentation methods, the proposed method has the advantages of fast inference speed and high detection accuracy.

It can capture both RGB images and depth which are of significant use in measuring cracks and potholes. This sensor is able to take image of surfaces with adequate resolution to detect cracks along with measurement of distance between sensor and obstacles in front of it which results in depth of defects.This technology has been very recently studied by few researchers in different fields of studies such as project management, biomedical engineering, etc. Pavement management has not paid enough attention to use of Kinect in monitoring and detecting distresses.

The inspection and maintenance of asphalt pavements not only concern road safety and efficiency but also directly impact the rational allocation of resources and environmental sustainability. To address the challenges of modern transportation infrastructure management, this study innovatively proposes a hybrid learning model that integrates deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) and support vector machines (SVMs). Specifically, the model initially employs a ShuffleNet architecture to autonomously extract abstract features from various defect categories. Subsequently, the Maximum Relevance Minimum Redundancy (MRMR) method is utilized to select the top 25% of features with the highest relevance and minimal redundancy. After that, SVMs equipped with diverse kernel functions are deployed to perform training and prediction based on the selected features. The experimental results reveal that the model attains a high classification accuracy of 94.62% on a self-constructed asphalt pavement image dataset. This technology not only significantly improves the accuracy and efficiency of pavement inspection but also effectively reduces traffic congestion and incremental carbon emissions caused by pavement distress, thereby alleviating environmental burdens. It is of great significance for enhancing pavement maintenance efficiency, conserving resource consumption, mitigating environmental pollution, and promoting sustainable socio-economic development.

In order to assess the ability of HWD testing to detect debonding of the interfaces between pavement layers, the French civil Aviation technical center (STAC) performed an HWD campaign on the circular Accelerated Pavement Testing (APT) facility of IFSTTAR in Nantes, on an experimental pavement with artificially created local sliding interface between bituminous surface and base layers. Both the sound and the defective tested pavement sections present a common structure in terms of subgrade, materials and layer thicknesses. HWD tests have been performed along a large circular arc covering the two sections. Afine spatial measure discretization (10 cm) was used. The experimentation shows that the HWD is a valuable tool for the detection of extended interface defects detection, the central deflection being significantly affected by the interface quality, the outer deflections being less sensitive to this parameter. This paper presents raw deflection results, allowing to precisely locate the underlying defects in the test section. Then a numerical study is detailed, which aims at assessing the effect of the bonding conditions over deflections. The theoretical analysis of thisHWDsurvey is performed in two steps: firstly, on the basis of the finite elements method (FEM) dynamical modeling of the HWD test developed by the STAC, a backcalculation of material moduli is performed using the deflections measured in the sound area. Secondly the backcalculated moduli are introduced in a forward calculation, taking into account the debonded interface. The numerical results are compared with experimental deflections measured over the defects. They are consistent with in situ results.

In this paper, we propose DARNet, a network for pavement distress extraction. A Distress Aware Attention Module (DAAM) is proposed to solve the problem of discontinuity in distress extraction due to inaccurate recovery of distress pixels during upsampling. Based on the characteristics of distress morphology, a Refinement Extraction Module (REM) is designed to effectively capture horizontal and vertical pavement damage features by fusing high-level and low-level features, which improves the accuracy of the model in extracting details of pavement damage information. Finally, a Weighted Cross-Entropy Loss function (WCEL) is introduced to assign weights according to the distance of the pixel point to the boundary of the distress, which solves the problem that the traditional cross entropy function treats each pixel point equally.

abstract = {This study conducts a rigorous analysis of the moisture diffusion mechanism that undermines the adhesive layer of epoxy asphalt (EA) pavement on steel bridge decks, thereby fostering latent distresses. Furthermore, a novel and highly efficacious approach for detecting these concealed distresses is introduced. The findings of water vapor permeability tests conclusively reveal that the moisture diffusion coefficients of the upper and lower layers of the EA pavement stand at 0.1238 mm2/s and 0.0879 mm2/s, respectively, highlighting this disparity as the primary trigger for concealed issues like pavement delamination and swelling. Leveraging the combined capabilities of three-dimensional ground-penetrating radar (3D-GPR) and infrared thermography, this research reliably detects, identifies, and pinpoints concealed defects at three strategic locations on the steel bridge deck. The integration of these two technologies has exhibited remarkable proficiency in identifying concealed damages. Consequently, this study lays a substantial foundation for evaluating and detecting concealed distress in EA pavements atop steel bridge decks.

abstract = {Many image processing techniques (IPTs) were proposed to inspect pavement defects for improving the precision and efficiency of the on-site inspections by humans. However, the various pavement conditions led to the unacceptable stability of IPTs. Therefore, an application of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) is presented for pothole detection using digital images in this study. Two CNNs, called conventional CNN and pre-pooling CNN, were designed, trained, and tested using 96,000 pavement images. Additionally, a stability study and comparative study were conducted based on the testing results. The main difference between the two CNNs was that a pre-pooling layer was used in the pre-pooling CNN to pre-process pavement images before the first convolutional layer. The results demonstrated that the optimised pre-pooling CNN had the 98.95% recognition precision in the testing. The stability study indicated that the optimised CNN model had the robustness in various real-world situations (e.g. light conditions and pavement materials). Compared with the traditional IPT methods, the CNN had a higher precision for extracting pothole features autonomously.

Current methods focus primarily on developing supervised learning architectures, which are limited by the scarcity of annotated image datasets. The use of data augmentation with synthetic images created by generative models to improve these supervised systems is not widely explored. The few studies that do focus on generative architectures are mostly non-conditional, requiring extra labeling, and typically address only road crack defects while aiming to improve classification models rather than object detection. This study introduces AsphaltGAN, a novel class-conditional Generative Adversarial Network with attention mechanisms, designed to augment datasets with various rare road defects to enhance object detection. An in-depth analysis evaluates the impact of different loss functions and hyperparameter tuning. The optimized AsphaltGAN outperforms state-of-the-art generative architectures on public datasets.

abstract = {Mastering a lightweight method for the identification of pavement surface cracks plays a vital role in enhancing the efficiency and accuracy of pavement crack detection. However, the existing crack detection methods typically concentrate on improving model performance while neglecting the study of lightweight identification methods, causing inefficient crack detection. Therefore, this study aims to investigate a lightweight identification method for pavement cracks. High-definition vehicle-mounted cameras were employed to collect pavement crack images across multiple districts in Shenzhen, China, resulting in a dataset containing 20256 images. In addition, a pavement crack detection method based on the You Only Look Once version 8 (YOLO v8) model was proposed. On this basis, a knowledge distillation model enhanced by multiple teacher-assistants (KDMTA) was established to explore the impact of different teacher assistants and distillation paths on model performance. The results indicate that in the proposed KDMTA model, each level of teacher-assistant (TA) model can absorb diverse aspects of knowledge from the teacher models, thus broadening the range of insights. Subsequently, the information is imparted to lower-level TA models and the student model, expanding the perspective from which the student model acquires knowledge. Therefore, this improves the model's generalization performance and its effectiveness in target detection. The type and number of teacher assistant models, as well as the distillation path, influence the model performance. The random learning strategy enriches the combination and transfer of knowledge among teacher models, TA models, and student models, achieving lightweight identification for pavement crack. According to the results, the crack identification accuracy reaches 95.79 %, the mAP reaches 81.07 %, and the image processing speed has been improved by 79.6 %. This study enhances the efficiency and accuracy of pavement crack detection, providing methodological support for the rapid and accurate identification of pavement cracks. This study offers a novel method for the rapid and accurate identification of pavement cracks, which can assist management authorities to timely identify and repair pavement defects, reducing maintenance costs, and extending the lifespan of roads.

Moreover, processing the collected data for understanding the road condition is also a manual task. In this paper, a framework that automates the process is presented. Video data collected from the car's parking camera is utilized to detect defects in frames. Simultaneously, elevation signals collected from accelerometers attached to the car are processed to reconstruct the profile of the road and detect defects associated with its z-axis, such as bumps. A GPS device is synchronized with the other sensors to acquire the data's geolocation. Detected defects are then classified according to their type and their severity is assessed. All information is then transferred via 4G network to a central server, where the Road Condition Index of road segments necessary to classify roads is calculated. Finally, everything is saved in a Pavement Management System. Preliminary results on the processing of video data demonstrate the frameworks' promising application. The initial identification of frames including defects produces an accuracy of 96% and approximately 97% precision. Further experiments on such frames, aiming at the detection of potholes, patches and three different types of cracks result in over 84% overall accuracy and over 85% precision.

abstract = {The conventional method for detecting road defects relies heavily on manual inspections, which are often inefficient and struggle with precise defect localization. This paper introduces a novel approach for identifying and locating road defects based on an enhanced ML-YOLO algorithm. By refining the YOLOv8 object detection framework, we optimize both the traditional convolutional layers and the spatial pyramid pooling network. Additionally, we incorporate the Convolutional Block Attention to effectively capture channel and spatial features, along with the Selective Kernel Networks that dynamically adapt to feature extraction across varying scales. An optimized target localization algorithm is proposed to achieve high-precision identification and accurate positioning of road defects. Experimental results indicate that the detection accuracy of the improved ML-YOLO algorithm reaches 0.841, with a recall rate of 0.745 and an average precision of 0.817. Compared to the baseline YOLOv8 model, there is an increase in accuracy by 0.13, a rise in recall rate by 0.117, and an enhancement in average precision by 0.116. After the high detection accuracy of road defects was confirmed, generalization experiments were carried out on the improved ML-YOLO model in the public data set. The experimental results showed that compared with the original YOLOv8n, the average precision and recall rate of all types of ML-YOLO increased by 0.075, 0.121, and 0.035 respectively, indicating robust generalization capabilities. When applied to real-time road monitoring scenarios, this algorithm facilitates precise detection and localization of defects while significantly mitigating traffic accident risks and extending roadway service life.

abstract = {In recent years, deep learning-based detection methods have been applied to pavement crack detection. In practical applications, surface cracks are divided into inner and edge regions for pavements with rough surfaces and complex environments. This creates difficulties in the image detection task. This paper is inspired by the U-Net semantic segmentation network and holistically nested edge detection network. A side-output part is added to the U-Net decoder that performs edge extraction and deep supervision. A network model combining two tasks that can output the semantic segmentation results of the crack image and the edge detection results of different scales is proposed. The model can be used for other tasks that need both semantic segmentation and edge detection. Finally, the segmentation and edge images are fused using different methods to improve the crack detection accuracy. The experimental results show that mean intersection over union reaches 69.32 on our dataset and 61.05 on another pavement dataset group that did not participate in training. Our model is better than other detection methods based on deep learning.

In addition to the road traffic safety, maintaining the road infrastructure in a sound condition promotes a more productive and competitive economy. Due to the significant amounts of financial and human resources required to detect surface cracks by visual inspection, detection of these surface defects are often delayed resulting in deferred maintenance operations. This paper introduces an automatic system for acquisition, detection, classification, and evaluation of pavement surface cracks by unsupervised analysis of images collected from a camera mounted on the rear of a moving vehicle. A Hessian-based multi-scale filter has been utilized to detect ridges in these images at various scales. Post-processing on the extracted features has been implemented to produce statistics of length, width, and area covered by cracks, which are crucial for roadway agencies to assess pavement quality. This process has been realized on three sets of roads with different pavement conditions in the city of Brockton, MA. A ground truth dataset labeled manually is made available to evaluate this algorithm and results rendered more than 90% segmentation accuracy demonstrating the feasibility of employing this approach at a larger scale.

abstract = {Maintaining the integrity of urban road pavements is vital for public safety, transportation efficiency, and economic stability. However, aging infrastructure and limited budgets make it challenging to detect subsurface defects that can lead to pavement collapses. Traditional inspection methods are often inadequate for identifying such underground anomalies. Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR), especially dual-polarized array systems, offers a non-destructive, high-resolution solution for subsurface inspection. Despite its potential, effectively detecting and analyzing areas at risk of collapse in urban pavements remains a challenge. This study employed a dual-polarized array GPR system to inspect road pavements in London. The research involved comprehensive field testing, including data acquisition, signal processing, calibration, background noise removal, and 3D migration for enhanced imaging. Additionally, Short-Fourier Transform Spectrum (SFTS) analysis was applied to detect moisture-related anomalies. The results show that dual-polarized GPR systems effectively detect subsurface issues like voids, cracks, and moisture-induced weaknesses. The ability to capture data in multiple polarizations improves resolution and depth, enabling the identification of collapse-prone areas, particularly in regions with moisture infiltration. This study demonstrates the practical value of dual-polarized GPR technology in urban pavement inspection, offering a reliable tool for early detection of subsurface defects and contributing to the longevity and safety of road infrastructure.

abstract = {An entire roadway system represents a crucial element in the sustainable urban transportation planning process. Pavement surfaces are at continual risk of accumulating serious deteriorations and defects throughout their service life due to traffic loading and environmental impact. Since roadway networks are growing rapidly, relying on visual pavement inspection is not always feasible. Therefore, this paper proposes an effective assessment method for evaluating flexible pavement surface distresses using a terrestrial laser scanner (TLS) and calculating the pavement condition index (PCI). The proposed terrestrial laser scanner method results in road condition assessments becoming faster, safer, and more systematic. It also aims to determine the geometric characteristics of the investigated roads. A major road in Egypt was selected to test the proposed technique and compare it with the traditional visual inspection method. The evaluation was carried out to assess different types of pavement distress, such as cracking, rutting, potholes, and raveling distresses. Every pavement distress was defined in terms of surface area, the width of the crack, and intensity, and the data from TLS were then processed by MAGNET COLLAGE software. A MATLAB program was developed to match the TLS observational data to plane equations. PAVER software was also used to determine the PCI values for each TLS position. The revealed distresses for the investigated road using TLS observations reveal a significant improvement in determining flexible pavement distresses and geometric characteristics.

abstract = {Traffic loads and environmental factors cause various forms of distress on road pavements (cracks, depressions, potholes, ruts, etc.). Depressions and ruts produce localized variations of longitudinal and cross slopes, which are very hazardous for drivers, especially during rain. In such conditions, these defects alter the surface water path, creating abnormal water accumulations and significant water film depths to induce aquaplaning risk. In current practice, in preliminary analysis phases and at the network scale, the control of road surfaces is carried out with expeditious techniques and with synthetic indicators, e.g., pavement condition index (PCI), through which a quality judgment related to the detected distresses on the pavement surface, is given. In truth, the detection of specific defects (ruts and depressions) should also include further analyses to evaluate the hydraulic efficiency of the carriageway related to their severity. Therefore, in this paper, a synthetic indicator called Hydraulic Condition Index (HCI) is proposed for evaluating the hydraulic quality of road pavement surfaces. This index is related to the hydrologic conditions of the site, the pavement characteristics, and the defects that can alter the flow of water on the carriageway, determining and increasing the risk of aquaplaning. The methodological framework is discussed by means of some numerical applications developed for different road typologies according to their functional classification. The final aim is to provide road agencies with another solution to evaluate road quality and ensure safer roads for users. The methodological framework for evaluating the HCI may be adopted by the road agencies for the network-scale priority ranking of road segments maintenance needs also involving safety traffic conditions.

abstract = {Pavement evaluation helps assess the structural and functional condition of roads. Traditional pavement evaluation methods cannot efficiently and accurately assess the state of road conditions at the network level. Though the pavement evaluation techniques based on high resolution cameras and laser sensors assess the road conditions efficiently at traffic speeds, there are a few limitations in respect of automotive detection and quantification of pavement surface distress. Though artificial intelligence is a broad area, machine learning applications in highway engineering were proven to be successful. This paper presents the automated pavement distress classification using a convolutional neural network (NN) from the Keras library. VGG-16, the deep convolutional NN (DCNN) model, was deployed by necessary modification to get the desired output. The model is trained on a big data set of images with a wide range of pavement defects and irregularities. A DCNN classifier trained with an "Adam" optimizer was used to change the features of the NN to minimize the loss. As an output, the model classifies the pavement surface distresses as alligator cracks, longitudinal cracks, transverse cracks, pothole, and no crack portion of the pavement with maximum accuracy using a DCNN classifier.

abstract = {Surface cracks can be the bellwether of the failure of a road. Hence, crack detection is indispensable for the condition monitoring and quality control of road surfaces. Pavement images have high levels of intensity variation and texture content; hence, the crack detection is generally difficult. Moreover, shallow cracks are very low contrast, making their detection difficult. Therefore, studies on pavement crack detection are active even after years of research. The fuzzy Hough transform is employed, for the first time, to detect cracks from pavement images. A careful consideration is given to the fact that cracks consist of near straight segments embedded in a surface of considerable texture. In this regard, the fuzzy part of the algorithm tackles the segments that are not perfectly straight. Moreover, tiled detection helps reduce the contribution of texture and noise pixels to the accumulator array. The proposed algorithm is compared against a state-of-the-art algorithm for a number of crack datasets, demonstrating its strengths. Precision and recall values of more than 75% are obtained, on different image sets of varying textures and other effects, captured by industrial pavement imagers. The paper also recommends numerical values for parameters used in the proposed method.

We evaluated the performance of GPR-GAN using three datasets in conjunction with three state-of-the-art detection networks (faster region-based convolutional neural network (Faster RCNN), single-shot multibox detector (SSD), and YOLOv5). Our results reveal that GPR-GAN exhibits strong generalization skills, adeptly adapting to GPR data generation tasks that encompasses a variety of targets, frequencies, and equipment.

The data were collected in two stages covering the entire life cycle of the pavement structure using four GPR systems: An air-coupled ultra-wideband GPR (SF-GPR), two wideband 2D ground coupled GPRs (a SIR-4000 with a 1.5 GHz antenna and a 2.6 GHz-StructureScan from GSSI manufacturer), and a wideband 3D GPR (from 3D-radar manufacturer). The first stage of the experiments took place in 2012-2013 and lasted up to 300 K loadings. During this stage, the pavement structure presented no clear degradation. The second stage of experiments was conducted in 2019 and continued until the pavement surface demonstrated a strong degradation, which was observed at 800 K loadings. At the end of the GPR experiments, several trenches were cut at various sections to get the ground truth of the pavement structure.

Existing approaches depend heavily on manual works and expert experience, which are time-consuming and cost-effective. The paper presents an automated pavement damage detection and location method by adopting Mask R-CNN algorithm and active contour model. Mask R-CNN algorithm selects ResNet as the backbone network because of its strong feature extraction ability, and generates candidate target regions through 12 different anchors to further improve the accuracy of detection. Then, it is sent to the sub-network for classification and positioning. And contour of the diseased region is generated by Mask R-CNN. The region of the disease can be a preparatory knowledge for later road maintenance. But Mask R-CNN leads to the missing area due to inherent defects, the paper adopts active contour model to address the problem. The initial curve of the active contour model comes from the result of Mask R-CNN model and evolves under the action of internal energy and external energy. When the energy functional reaches the minimum, the curve converges to the edge of the object. The experimental result for pavement disease image shows the proposed method has desirable performance.

abstract = {To understand the research status of asphalt pavement texture, the related achievements and progress of pavement surface texture were systematically sorted out from three aspects: the characterization of pavement surface texture, the texture measurement and evaluation, and the relationship between texture and the skid resistance. Based on the statistical geometric characteristics, the spectral characteristics, the fractal characteristics and the multifractal characteristics, the characteristics of pavement texture were discussed. The test methods of pavement texture were divided into two categories: direct measurement methods and indirect measurement methods. The advantages and disadvantages of each measurement method were summarized. The effects of macro-texture and micro-texture on asphalt pavement were discussed, respectively. The relationship between texture and skid resistance was studied. This review shows that multifractal theory should be further studied from the aspect of road engineering. High-precision non-contact integrated detection technology should be further studied to meet the needs of complex testing environments. The method of finite element numerical simulation has potential for the analysis of pavement skid resistance. In addition, methods such as big data analysis, neural network, and deep learning should be studied to achieve the intelligent perception and management of the whole state of skid resistance prediction.

abstract = {Analysis of automated pavement image distress data requires large annotated datasets that can be used for training deep learning (DL) models. The lack of labeled data is a significant challenge in utilizing DL models for distress detection. Furthermore, developing the ground-truth is difficult in low-data regimes and the inconsistency in ground-truth is a challenge for deploying DL models for analyzing pavement distress data. Consequently, this study proposes the conditional Style-based Generative Adversarial Network (c-StyleGAN2) with Adaptive Discriminator Augmentation (ADA) to create synthetic images of pavement distresses using distress classes as conditional input. A novel technique has been utilized in this study to create high-resolution synthetic pavement images using moderate computational resources by upsampling through a super-resolution model Real-ESRGAN and blended into a no-distress background using Deep Image Blending. Thereafter, to evaluate the usefulness of including synthetic data in pavement condition evaluation, DeepLab v3 + was implemented for semantic segmentation and Mask R-CNN was implemented for instance segmentation on a few scenarios involving aggregated synthetic and real data as well as only real data. The models were trained both with and without using Transfer Learning. The results of this study show that synthetic data aggregation led to an increase in detection accuracy and that utilizing transfer learning by pretraining on synthetic data and fine-tuning on real data yielded the best performance.

By providing a thorough literature review on the specification of RGB-D sensors, this paper aims to assess and compare the performance of two RGB-D sensors in pavement condition data collection. First, by collecting data from asphalt, concrete, and mosaic surfaces in wet and dry conditions, the accuracy and precision of the sensors are evaluated. For this purpose, noise reduction techniques are applied to the central region of interest and the inherent trend of depth frames is corrected by implementing the Singular Value Decomposition algorithm. Second, dimensions of artificial objects above the pavement surface are detected via sensors by using the Lease Square Method (LSM) and edge detection techniques to evaluate RGB-D sensors' ability and performance in measurement of artificial pavement defects of known dimensions. The results of statistical analysis show the difference in error measurement via both sensors in all surfaces in wet and dry conditions.

First, the model uses the proposed CSPP to replace the SPPF in the original YOLOv8 model, which improves the ability of the model to extract key information from input features of different sizes; secondly, the resnet18 backbone is used to replace the original backbone of YOLOv8, which improves the feature extraction ability of the model; and finally, the proposed MSDhead detection head is used to replace the detection head of YOLOv8, which reduces the number of model parameters, reduces memory consumption, and effectively decouples feature information.

The images segmentation of pavement is the key to the pavement images processing steps. Because the noise have a great influence on the pavement images, the traditional fuzzy C-means clustering (FCM) algorithm to the image segmentation have not satisfied results. In this paper, partitioning threshold is used. The global threshold is determined by P-file algorithm and Histogram-based fuzzy C-means clustering algorithm; The local threshold is determined by the global threshold, P-tile algorithm and the feather of the images. For one thing the algorithm overcomes large amount of computing and the shortcomings of the slow speed of the traditional FCM; for another thing it reduces the scope of segmentation, and enhances the segmentation effectiveness; further more different subgraphs have different thresholds, so it avoids the defect of the global threshold, and make the image segmentation more accurate. The experimental results show that using algorithm in this paper it can better segment pavement cracks in the pavement images.

abstract = {Pavement damage detection is vital in ensuring road-users safety and reducing economic losses related to maintenance and road incidents, thus making it a highly discussed research topic. Non-destructive pavement damage inspection methods have been rigorously explored, compared and integrated in the road health and safety practices. In particular, 3D imaging stands out due to its ability to extract the depth and geometric characteristics of the detected defects, thus facilitating performing accurate maintenance and corrective actions. During the past few years, with the rise of the highly accurate and robust artificial intelligence-driven analysis, researchers have increasingly adopted machine learning and deep learning models in pavement damage assessment. This paper systematically and exhaustively reviews the use of artificial intelligence-based 3D automated damage detection of pavement performed using laser scanners, stereo cameras/structure from motion and infrared sensors. It compiled 85 contributions published between 2011 to mid-2024. From which, the adopted artificial intelligence models, utilized 3D data collection hardware, utilized datasets, 3D data preprocessing techniques and application domains were extracted, compared and critically analyzed. The survey ultimately highlights the gaps and potential future research directions. Key findings highlight the need to explore more cost-effective and advanced 3D data collection methods, such as drones, in addition to enhancing 3D data preprocessing techniques to boost AI performance. Furthermore, the lack of comprehensive open 3D datasets is a significant gap that, if addressed, could help standardize research. Moreover, the research highlights the need for expanding the use of AI models to cover a wider range of pavement deformities.

This study conducted a state-of-the-art review for surveying the recent progress of ANN application at different stages of pavement engineering, including pavement design, construction, inspection and monitoring, and maintenance. This study focused on the papers published over the last three decades, especially the studies conducted since 2013. Through literature retrieval, a total of 683 papers in this field were identified, among which 143 papers were selected for an in-depth review. The ANN architectures used in these studies mainly included multi-layer perceptron neural network (MLPNN), convolutional neural network (CNN) and recurrent neural network (RNN) for processing one-dimensional data, two-dimensional data and time-series data. CNN-based pavement health inspection and monitoring attracted the largest research interest due to its potential to replace human labor. While ANN has been proved to be an effective tool for pavement material design, cost analysis, defect detection and maintenance planning, it is facing huge challenges in terms of data collection, parameter optimization, model transferability and low-cost data annotation.

abstract = {Deterioration of asphalt road pavements is inevitable throughout its life cycle. There are several types of deterioration that take place on these surfaces, like surface defects and deformations. One of the most common asphalt defects is cracking. Fatigue, transverse, longitudinal, reflective, edge, block and slippage are types of cracking that can be observed anywhere in the world. Monitoring and preventative/periodic maintenance of these types of wears are two very important actions that have to take place to avoid "costly" solutions. This paper aims to introduce the spectral characteristics of uncracked (healthy) and cracked asphalt surfaces which can give a new asphalt crack index. This is performed through remote sensing applications in the area of asphalt pavements. Multispectral images can be elaborated using the index to enhance crack marks on asphalt surfaces. Ground spectral signatures were acquired from both uncracked and cracked asphalted areas of Cyprus (Limassol). Evaluation separability indices can be used to identify the optimum wavelength regions that can distinguish better the uncracked and cracked asphalt surfaces. The results revealed that the spectral sensitivity for the enhancement of cracked asphalt was detected using the Euclidean, Mahalanobis and Cosine Distance Indices in the Vis range (approximately at 450 nm) and in the SWIR 1 range (approximately at 1750 nm).

abstract = {Detection of road pavement cracks is important and needed at an early stage to repair the road and extend its lifetime for maintaining city roads. Cracks are hard to detect from images taken with visible spectrum cameras due to noise and ambiguity with background textures besides the lack of distinct features in cracks. Hyperspectral images are sensitive to surface material changes and their potential for road crack detection is explored here. The key observation is that road cracks reveal the interior material that is different from the worn surface material. A novel asphalt crack index is introduced here as an additional clue that is sensitive to the spectra in the range 450-550 nm. The crack index is computed and found to be strongly correlated with the appearance of fresh asphalt cracks. The new index is then used to differentiate cracks from road surfaces. Several experiments have been made, which confirmed that the proposed index is effective for crack detection. The recall-precision analysis showed an increase in the associated F1-score by an average of 21.37% compared to the VIS2 metric in the literature (a metric used to classify pavement condition from hyperspectral data).

Current research predominantly focuses on crack detection and segmentation, without devising end -to -end systems capable of effectively evaluating the most affected roads and assessing the out -of -sample performance. To address these limitations, this study proposes a public dataset with annotations of 7099 images and 13 types of defects, not only based on cracks, for the confrontation and development of deep learning models. These images are used to train and compare YOLOv5 sub -models based on pure detection efficiency, and standard object detection metrics, to select the optimum architecture. A novel post -processing filtering mechanism is then designed, which reduces the false positive detections by 20.5%. Additionally, a pavement condition index (ASPDI) is engineered for deep learning -based models to identify areas in need for immediate maintenance. To facilitate decision -making by road administrations, a software application is created, which integrates the ASPDI, geotagged images, and detections. This tool has allowed to detect two road sections in critical need of repair.

abstract = {Pavement defect segmentation is a fundamental task in the field of transport infrastructure inspection. Existing methods mainly focus on detection/segmentation for long and thin cracks. However, there are many other types of defects with various sizes and shapes that are also essential to segment, which brings more challenges toward detailed road inspection. To address the above problems and provide a more comprehensive understanding of the overall road conditions, we propose a three-stream neural network that combines spatial, contextual and boundary information for fine-grained defect segmentation. Specifically, the spatial stream captures rich low-level spatial features. The contextual stream utilizes an attention mechanism and models high-level contextual relationships over local features. To further refine the segmentation results, the boundary stream encodes detailed boundaries using a global gated convolution and generates additional boundary maps. By combining the above different information, our model can effectively produce pixel-wise predictions for fine-grained road inspection. The network is trained using a dual-task loss in an end-to-end manner, and experiments were performed on three newly collected datasets, i.e., a fine-grained defect dataset and two crack datasets, which shows that the proposed method achieves favorable segmentation results on complex multi-class defects, and is also able to segment single-class cracks.

Advances in deep learning and computer vision have improved the automated recognition of pavement distresses in road surface images. This task remains challenging due to the high variation of defects in shapes and sizes, demanding a better incorporation of contextual information into deep networks. In this paper, we show that an attention-based multi-scale convolutional neural network (A+MCNN) improves the automated classification of common distress and non-distress objects in pavement images by (i) encoding contextual information through multi-scale input tiles and (ii) employing a mid-fusion approach with an attention module for heterogeneous image contexts from different input scales. A+MCNN is trained and tested with four distress classes (crack, crack seal, patch, pothole), five non-distress classes (joint, marker, manhole cover, curbing, shoulder), and two pavement classes (asphalt, concrete). A+MCNN is compared with four deep classifiers that are widely used in transportation applications and a generic CNN classifier (as the control model). The results show that A+MCNN consistently outperforms the baselines by 1 similar to 26% on average in terms of the F-score. A comprehensive discussion is also presented regarding how these classifiers perform differently on different road objects, which has been rarely addressed in the existing literature.

The predominant approach involves image-based methods, which analyse pixel intensities and surface textures to identify defects. Despite popularity, image-based methods share the distinct limitation of vulnerability to weather and lighting changes. To address this issue, researchers have explored the use of additional sensors, such as laser scanners or LiDARs, providing explicit depth information to enable the detection of defects in terms of scale and volume.

abstract = {Automatic pavement crack detection is a critical technique in the intelligent transportation system, which can effectively replace the person with a machine to detect the pavement crack automatically. This task is excellently challenging due to the tiny texture and the various shapes of each crack object. Previous crack detection networks mainly aim to perform complicated multi-scale feature fusion to learn the semantic information of cracks. However, the typical symmetrical networks with high-to-low resolution are undesirable to extract detailed crack texture information, and these existing methods cannot effectively deal with the issue of the various shapes.This paper proposes a novel end-to-end U-shaped convolutional neural network, termed CrackUNet, for the pavement crack detection task. To extract the information of the tiny texture, we design a novel network-in-network structure, which can enlarge the receptive field and obtain multi-scale features by putting a sub-network into each convolutional layer. Besides, to handle the issue of the various shapes for the crack object, we exploit the deformable convolution to capture contextual information of each crack, which can further improve the performance of crack detection. We train and evaluate the proposed CrackUNet on three public pavement crack datasets. The quantitative experimental results illustrate that our network outperforms the current state-of-the-art methods with almost the same efficiency. Specifically, the precision, recall, and F1-score of the CrackUNet are approximately 92.27%, 93.99%, and 92.94%, respectively.

abstract = {Road pavement cracks detection has been a hot research topic for quite a long time due to the practical importance of crack detection for road maintenance and traffic safety. Many methods have been proposed to solve this problem. This paper reviews the three major types of methods used in road cracks detection: image processing, machine learning and 3D imaging based methods. Image processing algorithms mainly include threshold segmentation, edge detection and region growing methods, which are used to process images and identify crack features. Crack detection based traditional machine learning methods such as neural network and support vector machine still relies on hand-crafted features using image processing techniques. Deep learning methods have fundamentally changed the way of crack detection and greatly improved the detection performance. In this work, we review and compare the deep learning neural networks proposed in crack detection in three ways, classification based, object detection based and segmentation based. We also cover the performance evaluation metrics and the performance of these methods on commonly-used benchmark datasets. With the maturity of 3D technology, crack detection using 3D data is a new line of research and application. We compare the three types of 3D data representations and study the corresponding performance of the deep neural networks for 3D object detection. Traditional and deep learning based crack detection methods using 3D data are also reviewed in detail.

abstract = {Discovering damage in pavement videos is critical for the assessment of pavement conditions. Unfortunately, existing damage segmentation methods in pavement videos have problems of low efficiency, low accuracy, and difficulty in adapting to changes in the appearance of the damage. An automatic damage segmentation system for pavement videos is proposed. The system is formed of a similar feature extraction Siamese network (SFE-SNet) and a pavement damage segmentation Capsule Network called PDS-CapsNet. First, SFE-SNet is developed based on an improved Siamese network modified by a dynamically updating reference frame strategy to extract similar features of the target stream and the reference stream in pavement videos. The difficulty of adapting to changes in the appearance of damage is solved by the dynamic updating of the reference frame strategy. Second, for the first time, PDS-CapsNet is developed based on an improved CapsNet modified by using the padding convolution method, adding an upsampling layer and adding the target stream low-order feature strategy to segment damage in pavement videos. Then, two datasets containing 2386 images of pavement defects and 216 pavement videos are created for pre-training and precise training. The trained model achieves the Jaccard coefficient of 96.87% and F1-score of 95.79% on the validation set. Compared with five other state-of-the-art methods, the F1-score of the proposed model improved by 5.32%, 9.81%, 3.44%, 10.31%, and 8.99%, respectively. Subsequently, the proposed system is embedded in a pavement damage detection vehicle to realize the display of damage segmentation results in real time. An on-site experiment is carried out to verify the validity and accuracy of the system. PU  - ELSEVIER PI  - AMSTERDAM PA  - RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS},

abstract = {In order to realize real-time detection of road crack defects on edge devices with low computational power, we propose a Real-time detection algorithm of Nanodet pavement cracks incorporating attention mechanism for a wide range of domestic road crack detection practical needs. Based on the Nanodet model, the algorithm in this paper introduces the attention mechanism into the feature extraction structure and assigns different weights to the features to improve the attention of the network crack target. It adopts the SimOTA dynamic label matching strategy to optimize the training process, so that the model can make full use of the data set. Besides, it uses the Hard-Swish activation function instead of the original ReLU function to speed up the network training convergence speed and improve the robustness of the algorithm, so as to achieve fast and accurate recognition of the key parts of pavement cracks. Through experimental validation on the pavement crack data set, compared with several classical target detection algorithms, there are different degrees of improvement in recognition accuracy and detection speed. In this model, the number of parameters is only 0.96M, the occupied memory is 7.6 MB, the floating point computation is 2.21G, and the average accuracy in the test set reaches 95.51%, the FPS is 123 fps.

abstract = {Pavement cracks have the characteristics of complex topological structure, uneven intensity and complex background. Therefore, accurate pavement crack detection is still a challenging problem for road maintenance. Since the rapid development of deep learning, detection methods based on Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) have achieved excellent results in crack detection tasks. However, the CNN-based model does not fully grasp the global information. Global information is crucial for accurate detection results. Transformer is powerful at capturing global information. Therefore, this paper fuses the CNN and Transformer framework to present an accurate crack detection model. To enhance the representation ability of the Transformer for global features, based on the improved self-attention mechanism, an enhanced Transformer unit is proposed. Meanwhile, an axis orientation attention module (AOAM) is proposed to optimize the extracted features at the encoder side, which realizes attention along both height and width directions through the self-attention mechanism. Experiments show that proposed model achieves an excellent results on two publicly available crack datasets. PU  - IEEE PI  - NEW YORK PA  - 345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA},

abstract = {Road infrastructure, fundamental to daily life, inevitably sustains damage over time. Timely and precise identification and remediation of road defects are critical to prolong the lifespan of roads and ensure driving safety. Given the limitations of the widely-used You Look Only Once (YOLO) algorithm, including its insufficient receptive field and suboptimal detection accuracy, this paper introduces a novel road defect detection method. First, we propose a new attention mechanism, aggregate multiple coordinate attention, that effectively retains and concatenates channel information while preserving localization data, thereby enhancing the focus on intrinsic features. Second, we design a cross stage partial-partially transformer block (CSP_PTB) that combines CNNs and transformers to yield richer and more varied feature representations. Finally, we develop a novel neck structure, the re-calibrated feature pyramid network (Re-Calibration FPN), which selectively combines boundary and semantic information for finer object contour delineation and positional recalibration. Experimental results show that the S version of the algorithm in this paper achieves a detection accuracy of 73.2% on the road defect dataset, which is 4.2% higher than the YOLOv8 algorithm. Additionally, with an FPS of 80, it meets the requirements for real-time detection, achieving a good balance between detection speed and detection accuracy. Additionally, it exhibits excellent generalizability and robustness on the UAV asphalt pavement distress and PASCAL VOC 2007 datasets.

abstract = {The maintenance of pavements takes considerable time and poses a significant task, especially when it comes to detecting cracks at the pixel level. Due to the complexity of pavement conditions, such as road markings, shadows, and oil stains, deep learning techniques are still a challenge in automating crack detection. This paper presents a novel methodology termed as CrackHAM, which is an encoder-decoder network founded on the U-Net architecture. The primary objectives of CrackHAM are twofold: to achieve accurate and robust pavement crack detection while reducing the parameters of the network. Our study introduces two significant improvements to the existing neural network architecture, namely the phased multi-fusion module and the dual attention mechanisms. These improvements improve the process of defect extraction, resulting in an improved level of performance. Furthermore, a novel module named HASPP is devised to augment the network's capacity to acquire more comprehensive receptive fields. In order to lower the number of network parameters, a technique is employed whereby only use half of the number of input channels and output channels in the VGG16 are utilized as U-Net encoder modules. The empirical findings demonstrate that in the Deepcrack, Crack500, and FIND public datasets, CrackHAM achieves superior segmentation performance compared to the FCN, Deeplabv3, Swin-Unet, and U-Net models while utilizing only one-third of the computational resources.

In order to effectively solve the problems of low efficiency, high cost and poor performance of existing methods, a high-precision concrete defect detection method YOLOv8-CDD (Concrete Defect Detection) combining convolutional neural network and transformer is proposed in this paper. Firstly, based on the features with a large span of concrete defect features, a bot-transformer module that can effectively extract the global information of defect features is proposed to improve the network's ability to extract global features. Secondly, in order to further strengthen the interaction between defect feature channels and spatial information, a convolutional triplet attention module is introduced into the feature enhancement network to effectively integrate the information of different dimensions of defect features and improve the model detection accuracy. Additionally, in order to enhance the learning of samples with different degrees of difficulty, the introduction of Focaler-CIoU instead of the original boundary regression loss function can optimize the model training process.

abstract = {At present, crack detection is of grand importance for the maintenance of infrastructure, one of which the most crucial kind in China is roads. Road safety accidents, which are mainly caused by cracks, have a significant influence on people's property, life security and the economic development of the society. Thus, it is essential to accurately identify the pavement defects and promptly repair them in order to prolong the lifespan of the road, minimize maintenance expenses, prevent further deterioration of the road and decrease the occurrence of hazards. In recent years, deep neural networks have achieved a huge degree of success in crack detection, resulting in substantial savings in terms of manpower, time and money when compared to conventional approaches. Nevertheless, owing to numerous difficulties, including time-consuming pixel annotation, inadequacy in acquiring information, discontinuous cracks and low-quality images, the detection of pavement defects remains a great challenge, still having some tricky issues demanding fabulous solutions. To this end, we propose a novel Weakly-Supervised hybrid network with multi-attention, termed CGTr-Net, for pavement crack detection. Aiming at alleviating the loss of information, behaving well in extracting both local and global features, the architecture of the backbone CG-Trans was designed. It is a combination of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), which is expert in extracting local features but experiencing difficulties to capture global representations, and Gated axial Transformer, whose gated position-sensitive axial attention mechanism can efficiently extract long-distance feature dependencies but deteriorate in capturing local feature details. To enhance feature fusion between the Transformer Layer and the Convolution Layer, a feature fusion module (TCFF) was added to this network. The two feature maps obtained from Transformer and CNN are utilized to generate Grad-CAM. Subsequently, we use Conditional Random Field (CRF) to further refine the Grad-CAM and adapt Affinity from Attention (AFA), which learn semantic affinity from the Gated Axial Transformer and the Convolutional Neural Network, to produce more accurate pseudo labels. The proposed CGTr-Net is evaluated on two different crack segmentation datasets and our CGTr-Net achieves the highest scores of Recall (Re), F-score (F1) and the mean intersection-over-union (mIoU) on the two benchmark datasets, surpassing all the competitors in the experiment. These results demonstrate the robustness, effectiveness and the superiority of our CGTr-Net compared with existing state-of-the-art methods.

abstract = {Automatic pavement crack segmentation plays a critical role in the field of defect inspection. Although recent segmentation-based CNNs studies showed a promising pavement crack segmentation performance, a challenging task is still remaining due to the inhomogeneity of crack intensity, the complexity of pavement environments, a limited number of labeled training datasets, and the presence of noise in the majority of images in the crack dataset, which makes it difficult to distinguish the cracks from the noise. To overcome these challenges, this study aims to exploit the inherent relationship between classification and segmentation tasks to improve pavement crack segmentation. A hybrid deep learning pavement crack semantic segmentation is proposed based on knowledge transfer among the Class Activation Maps (KTCAM) and the encoder- decoder segmentation network (KTCAM-Net) via the capability of the revised CAM strategy. An adopted trained pavement crack classification network is used to produce high-quality crack localization maps. These localization abilities are fused with the encoder's image features and fed into the decoder network to provide an accurate pavement crack segmentation. Furthermore, a hybrid loss function is developed to optimize the segmentation network, capture information about thin cracks, and tackle the problem of class imbalance. Afterward, a novel refinement process is applied to purify the segmented crack boundaries. A comprehensive experimental comparison is conducting using four benchmark datasets: DeepCrack, Crack500, CFD, and CrackSC. The proposed KTCAM-Net demonstrates the state-of-the-art segmentation results.

With application to highway pavements and bridges, this paper presents conceptually how nondestructive evaluation (NDE) results can be utilized to provide a quantitative assessment of the infrastructure condition in a format usable for network-level pavement management systems and bridge management systems. NDE techniques typically applied to pavements include Visual Rating, Failing Weight Deflectometer (FWD), Dynaflect, Seismic Pavement Analyzer (SPA), and the Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR). Bridges can also be evaluated using the GPR. NDE is particularly useful at the network level of infrastructure management because of the mobility of conducting the tests. Detailed mechanistic methods have been suggested for NDE interpretation but this method may not be practical at network level. Interpretation of NDE results, through knowledge-based systems and intelligent databases indicate the defects and residual capacity of infrastructures, Measured physical properties and defects in the infrastructure component materials can be correlated to existing scales of condition assessment such as in the NBI and PONTIS formats for bridge management and also to an index or rating such as the PSI in highway pavements.

abstract = {Comfort and safe-mobility are two aspects that should be provided to non-motorized users that are an increasing component of the urban micro-mobility (e.g. bikes and e-scooters). For these road users, road pavement unevenness, cracks, potholes and other surface defects can make riding uncomfortable and potentially hazardous. Traditionally, road managers use standardized surveys and Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) of pavement to make decision for maintenance programs and pavement management of road urban network poses challenges in the survey of pavement surface for International Roughness Index (IRI) and distress assessment both for operational and cost constrains. Moreover, there are theoretically limitations of IRI model for low speed urban roads and low-damped vehicles like bikes and e-scooters. In such framework aims of the paper is to investigate the use of smartphone sensors to collect data for the assessment of pavement conditions and definition of KPIs for bike and e-scooter users' ride comfort and safety. A controlled experiment was performed with repeated runs of a bicycle and e-scooter equipped with a smartphone and an android application was used to collect acceleration and position data. Detailed pavement conditions have been identified with an advanced survey equipment. After data treatments for removing signal noise, adjustment for speed variability and outlier detection, root mean square (RMS) of vertical acceleration signal and weighted frequency content of the vibrations according to ISO 2631-1, have been confirmed suitable KPIs of pavement conditions and comfort rating that can be collected by bikes and e-scooter. Results confirmed the lack of correlation of vibrations in bikes and e-scooter with analogous parameters collected with car as probe vehicle and with IRI standard values, as well. Instead, pavement monitoring by bikes and escooter can provide effective detection of typologies and severities of distresses not detectable by similar approaches in damped vehicles. Good correlations have been identified between RMS and medium severity alligator, longitudinal and transversal cracks. High severity pavement distress and potholes have been identified by outliers in RMS. PU  - ELSEVIER PI  - AMSTERDAM PA  - RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS},

abstract = {Damage in a pavement structure is usually initiated in the asphalt layers, making the Rayleigh wave ideally suited to the detection of shallow surface defects. However, the practical application of crack detection methods in asphalt is hampered by the dispersive behaviour of the road pavement. A new digital signal processing technique for the measurement of the amplitude and phase of the direct and reflected Rayleigh waves, scattered from the boundaries of a vertical crack in asphalt, is presented in this paper for the first time. The method uses multiple receivers and hence it finds an approximate solution with a least square optimisation. The resonant peak frequencies of the reflection coefficient and the cut-off frequencies of the transmission coefficient are used for assessing the depth of the crack. The method proved to be successful for the in-situ assessment of the depth of cracks both numerically and experimentally, since it can cope with the dispersive and heterogeneous nature of asphalt. This work supports a paradigm-shifting approach to the in-situ crack evaluation of roads, for which the road is holistically treated as a dispersive medium.

In the whole life cycle of the road, the emergence of disease is unavoidable, so it is necessary to adopt relevant technical means to deal with the disease. This study comprehensively reviews the advancements in computer vision, artificial intelligence, and mobile robotics in the road domain and examines their progress and applications in road detection, diagnosis, and treatment, especially asphalt roads. Specifically, it analyzes the research progress in detecting and diagnosing surface and internal road distress and related techniques and algorithms are compared. In addition, also introduces various road governance technologies, including automated repairs, intelligent construction, and path planning for crack sealing. Despite their proven effectiveness in detecting road distress, analyzing diagnoses, and planning maintenance, these technologies still confront challenges in data collection, parameter optimization, model portability, system accuracy, robustness, and real-time performance. Consequently, the integration of multidisciplinary technologies is imperative to enable the development of an integrated approach that includes road detection, diagnosis, and treatment.

abstract = {The forward modeling of ground penetrating radar (GPR) is one of the core topics of road non-destructive testing. The relationship between antenna transceiver distance and cavity defect depth is of great significance to reveal features of radar signals. This paper conducted forward modeling of cavity defects in asphalt pavements based on the FDTD method. The cavity defects were filled with air. The simulated radar frequency was 400 MHz. The boundary conditions related to FDTD were determined. A total of 360 forward models of the experimental group and the control group were established. A new evaluation index SSIM-S (Structural similarity - Spearman rank order correlation coefficient) was proposed to characterize the relationship between different antenna transceiver distance and different cavity defect depth. The results indicate that a higher SSIM-S value corresponds to more pronounced features of cavity defect radar signals in the images. When the antenna transceiver distance is less than 25 cm, SSIM-S shows a positive correlation with cavity defect depth and a negative correlation with antenna transceiver distance. As the cavity defect depth increases, its influence by antenna transceiver distance decreases. Considering data volume and other practical detection issues, an antenna transceiver distance between 10 cm and 20 cm is optimal.

abstract = {Precisely identifying pavement cracks from charge-coupled devices (CCDs) captured high-resolution images faces many challenges. Even though convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have achieved impressive performance in this task, the stacked convolutional layers fail to extract long-range contextual features and impose high computational costs. Therefore, we propose a locally enhanced Transformer network (LETNet) to completely and efficiently detect pavement cracks. In the LETNet, Transformer is employed to model long-range dependencies. By designing a convolution stem and a local enhancement module, both low-level and high-level local features can be compensated. To take advantage of these rich features, a skip connection strategy and an efficient upsampling module is built to restore detailed information. In addition, a defect rectification module is further developed to reinforce the network for hard sample recognition. The quantitative comparison demonstrates that the proposed LETNet outperformed four advanced deep learning-based models with respect to both efficiency and effectiveness. Specifically, the average precision, recall, ODS, IoU, and frame per second (FPS) of the LETNet on three testing datasets are approximately 93.04%, 92.85%, 92.94%, 94.07%, and 30.80FPS, respectively.

This notwithstanding, there is a lack of methods and systems that are able to identify concealed cracks (particularly, bottom-up cracks) and monitor their growth over time. For this reason, the objective of this study is to set up a supervised machine learning (ML)-based method for the identification and classification of the SHS of a differently cracked road pavement based on its vibro-acoustic signature. The method aims at collecting these signatures (using acoustic-sensors, located at the roadside) and classifying the pavement's SHS through ML models. Different ML classifiers (i.e., multilayer perceptron, MLP, convolutional neural network, CNN, random forest classifier, RFC, and support vector classifier, SVC) were used and compared. Results show the possibility of associating with great accuracy (i.e., MLP = 91.8%, CNN = 95.6%, RFC = 91.0%, and SVC = 99.1%) a specific vibro-acoustic signature to a differently cracked road pavement.

We approach this challenge by developing a series of methods that generate high-resolution asphalt pavement crack segmentation, the HRCrack series, which attends to hairline cracks by repeatedly fusing hierarchical features learned using convolutional neural networks. We validated and compared the models with ten widely used models on six open crack datasets.

Crack detection is not an easy task since images of road pavement surface are very difficult to analyze. In this paper, a highly efficient pavement crack detection system is proposed, which has the following distinguishing features. Firstly, a new description of the cracks is proposed based on the spatially clustered pixels with similar gray levels. Secondly, an adaptive thresholding method is presented for image segmentation by comprehensively taking into account the spatial distribution, intensities and geometric features of cracks. Thirdly, a new concept termed Region of Belief (ROB) is introduced to facilitate the subsequent detection by defining some credibility factors which indicate the reliability that a region could be labeled as a distress region which contains cracks, and an algorithm to extract such ROBs is devised accordingly. Lastly, a novel region growing algorithm is propounded for crack detection, which features starting with an ROB seed, determining the searching scope with a specially devised rule, and searching and merging a ROB with different regions following a similarity criterion which synthetically takes different cues into consideration. Two different types of experiments were conducted. The first one was carried out using 10,000 of our field-captured images which were taken from different road conditions and environments. The second one was completed using a benchmark dataset for a comparison with other recent publications. The evaluation performance is satisfactory for a variety of different cracks. For our own data, the detection accuracy is over 95% and more than 90% of coherent cracks Without disconnected fragments have been correctly detected as the integrated ones. For the benchmark data, our detection performance also outperforms previously published results. Currently, our approach has been widely applied in China. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Based on the existing literature, it was found that the smartphone applications technology is feasible and accurate to some extent as an alternative for conventional technologies for rural, highways and airports PCM. However, this technology is still in the first stage and many factors, calibrations and standards need to be studied and developed in future research in different countries at the various environments and different smartphone features. For example, one of the shortcomings of using smartphone-based sensors technology is the collected data is not directly collected from the pavement surface but is inferred from the data that resulted from the interaction among the vehicle, driver and pavement. This data processing could create limitations on the accuracy of such technology. It is also expected that data generated by sensors will vary according to the smartphone properties, sensor conditions, behavior of drivers, vehicle dynamics and conditions that lead to differences in recorded data.

Given the inherent inaccuracy, time-consuming nature, and labor intensiveness of manual road crack detection, there's a compelling need for automated solutions. The irregular shape of cracks, along with complex background conditions encompassing varying lighting, tree shadows, and dark stains, poses a significant challenge for computer vision-based approaches. Most cracks exhibit irregular edge patterns, which are pivotal features for accurate detection. In response to recent advancements in deep learning within the realm of computer vision, this paper introduces an innovative neural network architecture termed the 'Selective Feature Fusion and Irregular-Aware Network (SFIAN)' designed specifically for crack detection on pavements. The proposed network selectively integrates features from multiple levels, enhancing and controlling the flow of valuable information at each stage while effectively modeling irregular crack objects. In an extensive evaluation, this paper conducts experiments on five distinct crack datasets and compares the results with twelve state-of-the-art crack detection methods, including the latest edge detection and semantic segmentation techniques. The experimental findings demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed method, surpassing baseline methods by a notable margin, with an increase of approximately 13.3% in the F1-score, all without introducing additional time complexity.

abstract = {Surface cracks can be the bellwether of the failure of any component under loading as it indicates the component's fracture due to stresses and usage. For this reason, crack detection is indispensable for the condition monitoring and quality control of road surfaces. Pavement images have high levels of intensity variation and texture content, hence the crack detection is difficult. Moreover, shallow cracks result in very low contrast image pixels making their detection difficult. For these reasons, studies on pavement crack detection is active even after years of research. In this paper, the fuzzy Hough transform is employed, for the first time to detect cracks on any surface. The contribution of texture pixels to the accumulator array is reduced by using the tiled version of the Hough transform. Precision values of 78% and a recall of 72% are obtaining for an image set obtained from an industrial imaging system containing very low contrast cracking. When only high contrast crack segments are considered the values move to mid to high 90%.

abstract = {Pavement disease detection is an important task for ensuring road safety. Manual visual detection requires a significant amount of time and effort. Therefore, an automated road disease identification technique is required to guarantee that city tasks are performed. However, due to the irregular shape and large-scale differences in road diseases, as well as the imbalance between the foreground and background, the task is challenging. Because of this, we created the deep convolution neural network-DASNet, which can be used to identify road diseases automatically. The network employs deformable convolution instead of regular convolution as the feature pyramid's input, adds the same supervision signal to the multi-scale features before feature fusion, decreases the semantic difference, extracts context information by residual feature enhancement, and reduces the information loss of the pyramid's top-level feature map. Considering the unique shape of road diseases, imbalance problems between the foreground and background are common, therefore, we introduce the sample weighted loss function. In order to prove the superiority and effectiveness of this method, it is compared to the latest method. A large number of experiments show that this method is superior in accuracy to other methods, specifically, under the COCO evaluation metric, compared with the Faster RCNN baseline, the proposed method obtains a 41.1 mAP and 3.4 AP improvement.

abstract = {Autonomous detection of structural defect from images is a promising, but also challenging task to replace manual inspection. With the development of deep learning algorithms, several studies have adopted deep convolutional neural networks (CNN) or fully convolutional networks (FCN) to detect cracks in pixel-level. However, a fundamental property of cracks, that they are rotation invariant, has never been exploited. Although the rotation-invariant property can be implicitly learned by data augmentation, the network needs more parameters to learn features of different orientations and thus tend to overfit the training data. In this study, a rotation-invariant FCN called ARF-Crack is proposed that utilizes the rotation-invariant property of cracks explicitly. The architecture of a state-of-the-art FCN called DeepCrack for pixel-level crack detection is adopted and revised where active rotating filters (ARFs) are used to encode the rotation-invariant property into the network. The proposed ARF-Crack is evaluated on several benchmark datasets including concrete cracks, pavement cracks and corrosion images. The experimental results show that the proposed ARF-Crack requires less number of network parameters and achieves the highest average precision values for all the benchmark datasets compared to other approaches. The proposed ARF-Crack has the potential of detecting other rotation-invariant defects. PU  - SPRINGER PI  - NEW YORK PA  - ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES},

abstract = {In recent years, the number of traffic accidents caused by road defects has increased dramatically all over the world, and the repair and prevention of road defects is an urgent task. Researchers in different countries have proposed many models to deal with this task, but most of them are either highly accurate and slow in detection, or the accuracy is low and the detection speed is high. The accuracy and speed have achieved good results, but the generalization of the model to other datasets is poor. Given this, this paper takes YOLOv5s as a benchmark model and proposes an optimization model to solve the problem of road defect detection. First, we significantly reduce the parameters of the model by pruning the model and removing unimportant modules, propose an improved Spatial Pyramid Pooling-Fast (SPPF) module to improve the feature signature fusion ability, and finally add an attention module to focus on the key information. The activation function, sampling method, and other strategies were also replaced in this study. The test results on the Global Road Damage Detection Challenge (GRDDC) dataset show that the FPS of our proposed model is not only faster than the baseline model but also improves the MAP by 2.08%, and the size of this model is also reduced by 6.07 M.

abstract = {Pavement crack detection poses a formidable challenge due to the intricate texture structures of cracks and the complex environmental settings in which they are situated. In recent years, the advancement of deep learning techniques has prompted a surge in the utilization of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based methods for pavement crack detection. While CNNs have exhibited remarkable results in crack detection tasks, they primarily excel at capturing local details with limited receptive fields, which can be insufficient for grasping global contextual information. Given the intricate nature of crack textures, it becomes imperative to leverage both global and local features for accurate detection. To address this issue, a transformer-based network with feature complementary fusion, refer to TFCF-Net, is introduced, which amalgamates Transformer and CNN architectures. Proposed TFCF-Net model prioritizes the Transformer branch for feature encoding, considering its strength in extracting global features, while the CNN branch is set as auxiliary encoding branch, which plays a complementary role for local feature extraction. Proposed TFCF-Net operates by utilizing global features as a foundation and iteratively refining them using local features, thus facilitating precise crack detection. This design enables proposed network to comprehensively capture both global and local information while judiciously fusing these two types of information based on the distinctive characteristics of cracks. To ensure effective fusion of global and local information, an Information Complementary Fusion (ICF) module is presented, which could efficiently merge the outputs of both encoding branches. To further optimize the fused information, a multi-dimensional attention (MA) module is proposed to embed into the, which enhances the model's ability to capture long-range dependencies by optimizing information from multiple dimensions. Additionally, to improve the quality of input features on the decoding side, a multi-dimensional attention feature representation (MAFR) module is proposed, which expands the receptive field of the deepest semantic information, enabling the extraction of multi-scale feature representations. This paper rigorously evaluate proposed TFCF-Net against state-of-the-art (SOTA) models using three publicly available pavement crack datasets. Experimental results unequivocally demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed TFCF-Net.

This practice is termed contractor acceptance testing (CAT) in this paper. Although CAT has helped transportation agencies to deal with a shrinking workforce and intensive construction schedules, it has been controversial. This paper provides insights into the technical and conceptual pitfalls of CAT. The technical pitfalls are revealed through Monte Carlo-based computer simulations of pavement specifications that use CAT. These simulations show that the verification process, which relies on the statistical F-test and t-test, is unreliable and can lead to erroneous pay decisions. The conceptual pitfalls are revealed by demonstrating that CAT encourages a quality-control approach that focuses on defect detection and containment, rather than defect prevention.

Different with general image with rich texture sematic information, road/bridge crack images are often in lack of semantic information which is vital for guiding segmentation. Thus, crack detecting task remains challenge in spite of great success of semantic segmentation neural networks. In this paper, we proposed a simple but powerful U-Net, named as "RAU-Net", to boost the crack detecting performance by recursive attention mechanism. First, the recursion residual block is used to extract low-level edge features. Then, attention mechanism is introduced for separating the saliency area and the irrelevant background area for accurate locating the cracks. Finally, recursive attention is equipped into U-Net architecture for efficient segmentation.

abstract = {Ground penetrating radar (GPR) is an effective tool for detecting internal defects in asphalt roads due to its non-destructive nature and high resolution. However, detecting defects in GPR images remains challenging, as existing models lack sufficient accuracy and are often complex and redundant. To address these issues, a lightweight real-time detection method based on ground-penetrating radar is proposed in this study. First, a field GPR image dataset of asphalt roads was collected and constructed. To address the limited defect sample data acquired by GPR, an efficient copy-and-paste augmentation method was employed. This method involved copying and pasting defect samples in GPR images while incorporating random scale jitter and position migration operations to generate a sufficient number of real defect samples. Second, the C2f-DSConv module and the SE attention mechanism were designed and introduced based on the YOLOv8 network to improve detection accuracy in the complex background environment of GPR images. Finally, a channel pruning strategy was used to prune the improved YOLOv8 network, reducing model complexity while maintaining detection accuracy. The final model achieves an average detection accuracy of 90.9% and a detection speed of 140.9 FPS. The results show that the proposed method combines both detection accuracy and real-time performance, further advancing the engineering application of internal defect detection in asphalt roads.

abstract = {Accurate detection of crack defects in infrastructure is crucial to ensure their safety and extend their service life. However, the presence of complex backgrounds, various shapes and sizes of crack defects, incomplete discontinuous crack defects, and class imbalance makes this task challenging. Traditional image processing techniques are sensitive to image noise and may miss cracks due to weak textures, complex lighting conditions, and other similar objects on the pavement. In recent years, deep learning-based segmentation networks have been proposed for crack defect detection, but they still face challenges in high-precision crack segmentation due to insufficient local feature processing, information loss caused by pooling operations, and limited receptive fields. To address these issues, we propose an end-to-end deep crack segmentation network, called PHCF-Net, which incorporates progressive and hierarchical context fusion. Firstly, the proposed network consists of progressive context fusion (PCF) and hierarchical context fusion (HCF) blocks for effective aggregation of global and local context information. Secondly, a multi-scale context fusion (MCF) block is proposed for multi-scale context extraction and aggregation. Finally, in order to solve the information loss problem caused by pooling operations, a hierarchical context fusion (HCF) block is proposed for effective aggregation of the deep and shallow features. In addition, a multi-scale input unit is also applied to the proposed segmentation network to obtain more context information. To evaluate the performance of PHCF-Net, we have conducted experiments on two publicly available crack segmentation datasets and compared its performance with mainstream segmentation models. The results demonstrate that proposed PHCF-Net achieves better pixel-level crack detection results and outperforms other advanced segmentation models.

Regardless of the benefits, several limitations are reported that prevent using this technique for pavement investigation on a broader scale. The problems associated with this procedure, such as the accuracy of the method and the difficulties in interpreting recorded signals, are discussed.

abstract = {Currently, cracks are the most common defect in pavement diseases. Long-term non-maintenance can lead to crack lengthening and expansion, causing serious traffic accidents, as well as shortening the service life of pavement cracks. Therefore, it is of utmost importance to maintain cracks at an early stage. Due to the effect of some challenging factors, such as various shape information of the cracks, complex textured backgrounds, light shadows, similar texture objects, micro cracks and other factors, accurate crack detection still faces a certain challenges. To solve the above problems, a dual-encoding multi-scale fusion network based on the combination of convolutional neural network (CNN) and transformer network is proposed, named DMF-Net. To obtain stronger feature representations, a dual-encoding path is built to acquire global context features and local detail information simultaneously, where global context features are extracted based on the transformer branch, and the local detail features are extracted based on the CNN branch to detect tiny details of the cracks. Meanwhile, an interactive attention learning (IAL) module is introduced to effectively fuse the global features from the transformer branch and the local detail information from the CNN branch, achieving mutual communication and learning of different feature information. In addition, to enrich the feature representation ability, an attention-based feature enhancement (AFE) module is introduced to acquire more global contexts. Furthermore, faced with the crack detection task with class imbalance issue, a triple attention module (TAM) is built to emphasize the micro cracks. Finally, in the segmentation prediction stage, the deep supervision mechanism is also introduced to accelerate the convergence speed of the model, and serve effective multi-scale feature fusion. Compared with the current mainstream segmentation models, excellent performance has been obtained, which could provide a feasible scheme for the early maintenance of pavement cracks.

The research aims to investigate asphalt pavements, analyzing the variations in the responses, which can reveal the presence of pathologies or defects. A case study was made acquiring data, at the State University of Campinas - UNICAMP, in Campinas - SP - Brazil, with antennae 270 and 1600 MHz, in pavements with visible defects of patching and alligator cracks, initially with the dry structure and later, wet. The results were processed in specialized software (Radan 7.0) to generate terrain profiles. The GPR showed effective when there is a change in material employed as in the case of patching, because it was possible to detect layers compromised by intensive request of traffic, the start and end of application of the patching and even deformations in the new layer. In contrast, the alligator cracking did not reach the same result, not presenting accuracy in recognizing the defect. The extent of defect was the only well defined feature in the images.

Three projects were investigated in this study to demonstrate the application of nondestructive testing technologies in this selection process. Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR), Falling Weight Deflectometer (FWD), and Dynamic Cone Penetrometers (DCP) were successfully used on these TxDOT projects. GPR was employed successfully to locate defects in the hot mix surface layer that were responsible for the chronic distress on US 69. This roadway was rehabilitated previously but the strategy used had not addressed the root cause of the pavement problem. FWD and DCP data were also used to determine the structural capacity or layer moduli of the pavement system that allows the designer to derive the overlay thickness. Coring and trenching were utilized to verify the defects detected in the GPR data. The advantage of nondestructive testing is that it provides a comprehensive evaluation of subsurface conditions throughout the entire project, not only at locations where coring and trenching are performed. Furthermore, GPR was employed to verify a rehab design of an old JCP pavement on SH 73. Originally, the plan called for pressure grouting to fill the subsurface voids. However, GPR found no voids under the JCP slab; this was validated in subsequent coring. Therefore the GPR results helped district personnel to eliminate the cost of the pressure grouting. For comparison purposes, GPR results from IH 45 and US 82 (where there were voids under JCP slabs) were utilized.

abstract = {The main purpose of modern roadways is to provide roadway users with both a comfortable and safe ride to their destinations. As such, they need pavements in good physical conditions to ensure safe and uninterrupted transportation of the public. During the previous decades, roadway engineers' interests have shifted towards maintenance and rehabilitation of existing pavement structures, rather than the construction of new structures. Nevertheless, pavement condition assessment (PCA) remains imperative both during construction for quality assurance purposes and during roadways' service life for efficient maintenance planning. Research and current practices have shifted towards a broadened utilization of advanced non-destructive testing systems that enable non-invasive PCA. The current investigation aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the geophysical methods available for modern roadways' assessment. Geophysical surveying techniques including ground penetrating radar (GPR) and those based on stress waves theory can substantially improve PCA. They cover roadway applications including layer thicknesses determination, stiffness estimation of asphalt and concrete pavements, as well as the determination of physical properties, subsurface defects detection and most recently density monitoring. In particular, it is demonstrated that GPR can assist pavement engineers at all stages of PCA from the construction process through density control and compaction monitoring. Furthermore, throughout a roadway's service life, GPR can be effectively incorporated as a supplementary tool for monitoring and evaluation within a pavement management system, contributing to optimizing roadways design and maintenance, preserving durable and sustainable structures, ensuring cost savings for road authorities and highway operators through enhanced decision-making processes.

Subsequently, the integration of bi-level routing attention into the network's head layer optimizes the attention mechanism, notably improving overall efficiency. Additionally, the replacement of the YOLOv5 backbone layer's C3 module with the C3-TST module enhances initial convergence efficiency in target detection. Comparative analysis against the original YOLOv5s network reveals a 2% enhancement in map50 and a 1.8% improvement in F1, signifying an overall advancement in network performance.

abstract = {In this article, we focus on the detection of the interlayer debonding of the asphalt airport pavement by the ground-penetrating radar (GPR) system. Since the interlayer debonding usually occurs in the shallow region of the asphalt airport pavement (several centimeters), it is difficult to interpret the anomalies or the defects from the GPR signals composed of many waves under the boundary conditions. Moreover, the wavelength of the ordinary GPR system is over several centimeters. Therefore, the spatial resolution of the system is not accurate enough to consider the millimeter thickness of the debonding layer. To overcome these problems, we propose a new method based on evaluating the lateral wave behavior of common midpoint (CMP) gathers collected by a multiple static GPR system. The multistatic GPR system is a stepped frequency continuous wave (SFCW) radar system, which consists of eight transmitting and eight receiving bowtie antennas. The system operates in the frequency range from 50 MHz to 1.5 GHz. After the validation of the simulation, the results of the interlayer debonding detection were evaluated by a field experiment obtained at Tokyo International Airport. The proposed method can detect the debonding layers which are less than 1 mm. Also, it is shown that our proposed method has a high consistency with the conventional acoustic finding method in the field measurement. It provides an innovative and effective method for the interlayer debonding detection of a partially damaged airport asphalt pavement, which is difficult to be observed by the ordinary GPR signals.

However, the microcrack displays low contrast and large noises in the image. Meanwhile, the width of the microcrack is small, and the area in the image is tiny, which brings additional challenges to the detection of microcracks on the terminal electrodes. To improve the performance of detecting microcracks, this article proposes a detection model with outline profile-guided feature augmentation and attention-based multiscale fusion, titled with MicroCrack-Net. In this method, the microcrack outline is utilized to guide the lossless feature extraction to strengthen unobvious microcrack features without pooling operation to avoid information loss of tiny defects during the layer-by-layer processing in the convolutional neural network. A gradual attention mechanism is proposed to attract the attention of the detection model to local defect areas in the image with noises. Multiscale feature extraction and fusion are designed to process the data in tensors of the same size.

The segmentation network is constructed based on an encoder-decoder architecture for precise pixel-level segmentation of the samples determined as crack images. Specifically, to extract multi-scale crack features, a novel multi-scale encoder module is designed by combining dilated convolution and residual structure. Then, a left-side path (LSP) is designed to alleviate the influence of class imbalance on feature extraction. Finally, an attention module with high-dimensional features guiding low-dimensional features (AM-HGL) is proposed to focus on crack-relevant features and suppress interference information. The effectiveness of the proposed TSPCS-Net is validated on a self-made unmanned aerial vehicles pavement crack (UAVPC) dataset and two public pavement distress datasets, and extensive experiments show that the proposed method outperforms current state-of-the-art methods in terms of segmentation performance and efficiency, which can meet the needs of pavement crack segmentation in practical application scenarios.

abstract = {The large span and heterogeneous components of multi-layered pavement structure usually bring about stochastic damage, and many modern approaches, such as ground penetrating radar, integral imaging and optical fiber sensing technology, have been employed to detect the degeneration mechanism. Restricted by the cost and universality, novel elements for pavement monitoring are in high demand. Optical fiber sensing technology for high sensitivity, long stability, anti-corrosion and resistance to water erosion then is considered. Therefore, a movable FBG sensor located in flexible pipe is developed, which has long stroke inside inner wall of the hollow pipe, and a full-scale shape of the structure could be sketched just with one FBG. Theoretical and experimental methods about establishing the relationship between wavelength variable and curvature have been provided, and function about reconfiguring the coordinate is converted to a mathematic question. Move over, transfer error modification has been taken into account for modify related error. Multi-layered pavement model embedded with this sensor will be accomplished to inspect its performance in later work. The work in the paper affords a feasible method for shape monitoring and would be potentially valuable for the maintenance and inverse design of pavement structure.

To address the purpose, ground penetrating radar (GPR) was used to acquire a large amount of image data along the longitudinal construction joints of plain concrete pavement in the field. The GPR image data was filtered to construct the dataset, containing 2185 tie bar reflected waves in 670 GPR images. Then, the YOLO series models, as the deep learning algorithms applied in inspecting the tie bars from GPR images, were well trained with the GPR training and validation sets. The comprehensive detection accuracy of the YOLOv4 model outperforms the YOLOv3, YOLOv3-tiny, and YOLOv4-tiny models in the test set. The mAP@0.5 value of the YOLOv4 model can reach 99.74%. All the signatures of tie bars in the testing GPR images, no matter whether they are incomplete, compressed, blurry with missing signal, or strong background noise, can be correctly and completely anchored using the bounding box based on the YOLOv4 model. Meanwhile, the detection speed of the YOLOv4 model for GPR data video is 50.8 frames per second. Therefore, the YOLOv4 model is reliable for automatically detecting the tie bars from GPR data in real-time.

Many random blisters and cracks appear in the asphalt concrete impervious facing of the Zhanghewan Pumped Storage Power Station selected for field tests. The detection by the GPR showed that the defects occurred only in the upper anti-seepage layer, and the drainage layer and the lower anti-seepage layer had no obvious defects, which were fully consistent with coring results. Therefore, GPR is a fast, non-destructive and reliable technique for detecting asphalt concrete impervious facing. At present, China is in the period of large-scale construction of pumped-storage power stations, and the demand for rapid inspection and maintenance engineering is also increasing.

abstract = {Poor condition of roads is a major factor for traffic accidents and damage to vehicles. A significant portion of car accidents is attributed to severe three-dimensional (3D) pavement distresses such as potholes, ruttings, and ravelings. Insufficient road condition assessment is responsible for the poor condition of roads. To inspect the condition of the pavement surfaces more frequently and efficiently, an inexpensive data acquisition system was developed that consists of a consumer-grade RGB-D sensor and an edge computing device that can be mounted on vehicles and collect data while driving vehicles. The RGB-D sensor is used for collecting two-dimensional (2D) color images and corresponding 3D depth data, and the lightweight edge computing device is used to control the RGB-D sensor and store the collected data. An RGB-D pavement surface data set is generated. Furthermore, encoder-decoder deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) consisting of one or two encoders, and one decoder trained on heterogeneous RGB-D pavement surface data are used for pothole segmentation. Comprehensive experiments using different depth encoding techniques and data fusion methods including data- and feature-level fusion were performed to investigate the efficacy of defect detection using DCNNs. Experimental results demonstrate that the feature-level RGB-D data fusion based on the surface normal encoding of depth data outperform other approaches in terms of segmentation accuracy, where the mean intersection over union (IoU) over 10-fold cross-validation of 0.82 is achieved that shows a 7.7% improvement compared with a network trained only on RGB data. In addition, this study explores the efficacy of indirectly using depth information for pothole detection when depth data are not available. Additionally, the semantic segmentation results were utilized to quantify the severity level of the potholes assisting in maintenance decision-making. The result from these comprehensive experiments using an RGB-D pavement surface data set gathered through the proposed data acquisition system is a stepping stone for opportunistic data collection and processing through crowdsourcing and Internet of Things in future smart cities for effective road assessment. Finally, suggestions about the improvement of the proposed system are discussed. PU  - ASCE-AMER SOC CIVIL ENGINEERS PI  - RESTON PA  - 1801 ALEXANDER BELL DR, RESTON, VA 20191-4400 USA},

Leveraging deep learning frameworks for object detection offers a promising solution to these challenges. However, the complexity of backgrounds, low resolution, and similarity of cracks make detecting road cracks with high accuracy challenging. To address these issues, a novel road crack detection algorithm, termed Road Defect Detection YOLOv5 (RDD-YOLOv5), was proposed. Firstly, a model was proposed to integrate the transformer structure and explicit vision center to capture the long-distance dependency and aggregate key characteristics. Additionally, the Sigmoid-weighted linear activations in YOLOv5 were replaced with the Gaussian Error Linear Units to enhance the model's nonlinear fitting capability. To evaluate the algorithm's performance, a UAV flight platform was constructed, and experimental freebies were provided to boost inspection efficiency. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of RDD-YOLOv5, achieving a mean average precision of 91.48%, surpassing the original YOLOv5 by 2.5%. The proposed model proves its ability to accurately identify road cracks, even under challenging and complex traffic backgrounds.

Conventionally, road surface monitoring relies on specialised vehicles equipped with professional devices, but such dedicated large-scale road surveying is usually costly, time-consuming, and prohibitively difficult for frequent pavement condition monitoring-for example, on an hourly or daily basis. Current advances in technologies such as smartphones, machine learning, big data, and cloud analytics have enabled the collection and analysis of a great amount of field data from numerous users (e.g., drivers) whilst driving on roads. In this regard, we envisage that a smartphone equipped with an accelerometer and GPS sensors could be used to collect road surface condition information much more frequently than specialised equipment. In this study, accelerometer data were collected at low rate from a smartphone via an Android-based application over multiple test-runs on a local road in Ireland. These data were successfully processed using power spectral density analysis, and defects were later identified using a k-means unsupervised machine learning algorithm, resulting in an average accuracy of 84%. Results demonstrated the potential of collecting crowdsourced data from a large population of road users for road surface defect detection on a quasi-real-time basis.

Image-based distress identification is increasingly becoming an integral part of traffic speed network-level road condition surveys. This allows an aggregated summary of road conditions over the whole network, so it does not require an exact distress location within the lane. In this context, multi-label classification (MLC), based on convolutional neural networks (CNN), is proposed as a potential solution for distress identification from a network-level right-of-way (ROW) video survey. MLC has the advantage of low computing resource consumption, as it is implemented from lightweight classification networks. In this work, the developed MLC models used three different CNN architectures (VGG16, ResNet-34, and ResNet-50) to detect potholes, cracks, patches, and bleeding. The best model obtained 97% average accuracy with an F1-score of 93% in distress identification despite the variability in imaging hardware. This makes it possible to generalize the classification algorithm, allowing versatile applications and incorporating it into network-level pavement management systems. This model has good potential for fast and accurate distress identification from a video survey, avoiding the need for various types of expensive sensors like laser scanners.

abstract = {It is important to distinguish between two common defects, fatigue cracks and reflective cracks, and determine their locations (the top and bottom) in the highway pavement because they require individually targeted treatment measures. Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) has the potential to detect cracks in the highway pavement due to the change of the electromagnetic properties of highway-pavement media, arising from the existences of cracks. By using a theoretical analysis and a numerical simulation, we compare the characteristics of corresponding radargrams, including the amplitude variation of diffracted waves with various models of presetting cracks inside the layered homogeneous media. For those fatigue cracks and reflective cracks extending to the road surface, the amplitude curves of direct ground wave can intuitively indicate the locations of the top of the cracks and qualitatively compare the width of these cracks. Furthermore, we find that the shape and pattern of diffraction hyperbolas of both types of cracks with bottoms at different locations are quite similar, but their amplitudes are significantly different. To be specific, for those cracks with the same width, the amplitude of diffracted waves generated by fatigue cracks is slightly higher than that generated by reflective cracks at the interface between the asphalt surface and the semi-rigid base layer. In contrast, the amplitude of the former is significantly lower than the latter at the interface between the semi-rigid base and the roadbed. We applied these findings to the interpretation of the field GPR data of a highway pavement in China, and successfully identified the locations of the cracks and corresponding types. Our model results and field results clearly show the efficiency of our findings in the detection of cracks for highway-pavement rehabilitation.

abstract = {Efficient road inspection and maintenance are essential to extend pavement lifespan and enhance safety. However, automated crack detection remains challenging due to varied environmental conditions and differences in image collection equipment, making robust algorithm development a critical need. Vision Transformers, with their capacity to capture long-range dependencies, offer significant advantages for crack detection in complex scenarios by effectively extracting global features. Nevertheless, existing Transformer-based methods encounter difficulties in boundary delineation due to decoder design limitations, which lead to suboptimal fusion of low-level and high-level features. To address this issue, we propose a comprehensive approach that integrates semantic preservation, detail refinement, and detail delineation. These concepts are realized through our novel Dual-Cross Attention Module (DCA) and Upsampling Attention Module (UA). The DCA module progressively filters redundant details from low-level feature layers using high-level semantic information, while preserving boundary details to refine high-level feature boundaries. In addition, the UA module employs progressive local cross-attention in upsampling, facilitating more precise boundary definitions and surpassing conventional dynamic upsampling methods. Our approach, utilizing both lightweight (MiT-B0, LVT) and middleweight (Swin-T) backbones, demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on three diverse datasets-Crack500, CrackSC, and UAVCrack500-highlighting its robustness across varied conditions. This work contributes to advancing Transformerbased architectures for defect segmentation in complex engineering contexts, underscoring the critical role of improved feature fusion in crack detection.

abstract = {Surface defect detection (SDD) is the necessary technique to monitor the surface quality of production. However, fine grain defects caused by stress loading, environmental influences, and construction defects is still a challenge to detect. In this research, the convolutional neural network for crack segmentation is developed based on the feature fusion and feedback on the global features and multi-scale feature (GAF-Net). First, a multi-scale feature feedback module (MSFF) is proposed, which uses four different scales to refine local features by fusing high-level and sub-high-level features to perform feedback correction. Secondly, the global feature module (GF) is proposed to generate a fine global information map using local features and adaptive weighted fusion with the correction map for crack detection. Finally, the GAF-Net network with multi-level feature maps is deeply supervised to accelerate GAF-Net and improve the detection accuracy. GAF-Net is trained and experimented on three publicly available pavement crack datasets, and the results show that GAF-Net achieves state-of-the-art results in the IoU segmentation metrics when compared to other deep learning methods (Crackforest: 53.61 %; Crack500: 65.19 %; DeepCrack: 81.63 %).

In order to research the effect of the voiding pavement structure for the responding electromagnetic wave, a test of detecting voids using GPR was conducted to reveal the effect of frequency of principal antennas and the size of voids for responding waves. The frequency, voiding heights and voiding area affect the reflecting waves in different ways. Compared with 400MHz and 2000MHz, we can get the best apparent reflecting waves with a 1000MHz antenna. The resolution depends on the voiding area in that the reflecting wave patterns would become too fuzzy to identify when the height is less that 1cm. When the voiding area is increasing, the seismic event of diffracted waves is becoming more and more twisted. But the relationship of both arear of twisted event and the voiding area can not be determined with the patterns.

abstract = {A critical assessment criterion for road condition assessment is the amount and severity of cracking. Cracking causes a loss of structural capacity (i.e. strength and stiffness) and if severe can cause water infiltration into the subbase and subgrade, potentially leading to more serious structural failure. The onset of cracking therefore accelerates the processes of deterioration of the road. To date the accurate and reliable automated detection of road surface cracking is still problematic.Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) has the potential to detect cracks in materials as they cause changes in electromagnetic reflection. This paper proposes a method of automatic detection of road surface cracks using GPR and establishes the limits of its potential regarding the detectable crack size.Tests were conducted on asphalt pavement samples in a controlled laboratory environment. Significant changes in diffracted signal levels were observed in the GPR image when the image was analysed using a Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) algorithm for clutter reduction and a median filter to reduce noise. Moreover, a manifestly enhanced performance was achieved using a novel post-processing technique, which enabled the detection of cracks larger than 1.3 mm in width. The detected cracks were detectable irrespectively of the simulated physical conditions suggesting that the developed methodology is robust for use in practice. The experimental results indicate that the GPR system can be applied to automatically detect road cracking reliably in practice. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

A decaying road may contain many very small cracks, and such small artifacts can be difficult to identify using conventional ground penetrating radar (GPR) techniques. A new approach is examined here to detect the scattering from the multitude of small defects in the ground. Consideration is given to the layout of suitable antennas to sensitise a GPR system to the laterally propagating cross-polarised signals that voids in a road will produce.A self-shielded antenna with a circularly symmetrical beam pattern is used to transmit vertically downwards. This is surrounded by a number of wide band dielectric wedge directional antennas, oriented to pick up the cross-polarisation of the scattered signal. The two antenna types and their groundplane configuration have reduced direct path coupling and therefore maximise system sensitivity. Tests over asphalt slabs with 7% and 3% changes in density and porosity show that quite significant changes in signal level make such changes in porosity detectable.

However, one defect of the GPR method is that the measurement tolerance is, so far, lower than the core sampling method. To improve the measuring accuracy of GPR method is a very important task to the GPR developers. For the rebar-free pavement, many algorithms have been proposed to accurately determine the layer parameters from GPR data. For the rebar-reinforced concrete pavement, the rebar's effect is an important factor that influences the determination of pavement thickness from GPR data. Though some features of rebar's reflection have been studied, like the data collected along traverses showing rebar as individual scattering hyperbola, or rebar responding strongly to the incident GPR waves only when the rebar is located parallel to the polarization of GPR antennas, how to extract rebar's scattering fields from the measured GPR data and cancel rebar's influence in pavement thickness estimation have not been reported. In this paper, a new algorithm for extracting rebar's reflection fields from measured GPR data is proposed. This algorithm uses two-dimensional GPR data to establish a set of functional, the variables of which include rebar depths, rebar spacing, pavement thickness, pavement electrical parameters, GPR transmitted waveform and rebar's reflection fields. By minimizing the established functional, the above variables can be determined. The proposed algorithm not only extracts the rebar's reflection fields, but also solves the other pavement parameters.With the implementation of the proposed algorithm, the measured results on highways show that the measurement tolerance is less than 5%.

There was a genetic relationship between the clustering data and the technical characteristics of the classified sub-sections, and the internal crack rate was important for the characterisation of internal defects in asphalt pavement sub-sections and the determination of maintenance needs. The results of section classification varied considerably between clustering methods, and the choice of clustering method had a relationship to the pavement maintenance objectives. The dynamic clustering method combined with principal component analysis could significantly improve the significance of the differences in the clustering results, effectively improving the division of maintenance sections.

abstract = {The mechanical behavior of soils is partly affected by their clay content, which arises some important issues in many fields of employment, such as civil and environmental engineering, geology, and agriculture. This work focuses on pavement engineering, although the method applies to other fields of interest. Clay content in bearing courses of road pavement frequently causes damages and defects (e.g., cracks, deformations, and ruts). Therefore, the road safety and operability decreases, directly affecting the increase of expected accidents. In this study, different ground-penetrating radar (GPR) methods and techniques were used to non-destructively investigate the clay content in sub-asphalt compacted soils. Experimental layout provided the use of typical road materials, employed for road bearing courses construction. Three types of soils classified by the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO) as A1, A2, and A3 were used and adequately compacted in electrically and hydraulically isolated test boxes. Percentages of bentonite clay were gradually added, ranging from 2% to 25% by weight. Analyses were carried out for each clay content using two different GPR instruments. A pulse radar with ground-coupled antennae at 500 MHz centre frequency and a vector network analyzer spanning the 1-3 GHz frequency range were used. Signals were processed in both time and frequency domains, and the consistency of results was validated by the Rayleigh scattering method, the full-waveform inversion, and the signal picking techniques. Promising results were obtained for the detection of clay content affecting the bearing capacity of sub-asphalt layers. (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

This paper highlights the importance of these technologies in improving road inspection, maintenance, and safety. Traditional methods for inspecting roads are often time-consuming, expensive, and can put human inspectors in dangerous situations. However, drones equipped with high-resolution cameras and sensors can capture pavement image data quickly and safely. Deep learning algorithms can then analyze this data to identify and localize areas in need of repair. By leveraging these technologies, engineers and road construction experts can more efficiently monitor and maintain roads, reducing the costs associated with repairs and maintenance, while in parallel improving safety. To this end, this work emphasizes the potential of UAVs in conjunction with deep learning techniques to provide a more comprehensive view of road conditions, allowing for targeted repairs and more effective maintenance strategies, such as prefabrication and robotic interventions. Experimental results using objective evaluation criteria, such as precision, recall, F1-score, and IoU are promising, which entails that this study advocates for the adoption of these technologies to enhance the monitoring and maintenance of road infrastructures.

abstract = {Mixture segregation is a common defect in the construction of epoxy asphalt mixture (EAM) deck pavement. The segregation can affect the compaction quality of EAM deck pavement, while the compaction action can also change the segregation degree in the EAM. Therefore, the appropriate compaction technique can decrease the mixture segregation. The objective of this study is to investigate the mutual effect of mixture segregation and EAM compaction. To achieve this goal, the Superpave gyratory compaction (SGC) test was conducted, and a field compaction DEM (Discrete element method) model for EAM on the steel bridge deck was developed using a partitioned deposition method, to study the segregation characteristics of EAM during the compaction. Results show that the partitioned distribution segregation of aggregate in the EAM decreases first and then increases with the increase of gyration compactions. As a thermosetting material, the segregation is more likely to occur in the lowly cured EAM during the compaction process. In the field compaction, the initial vertical distribution segregation of loose EAM has a significantly negative effect on the compaction quality of EAM deck pavement, while the compaction action could also influence the segregation degree of EAM. Under the over repeated compaction, the increasing 1segregation degree of fine EAM particles and too tight contact between EAM particles make the extrusion separation of asphalt mastic between the coarse particles, which could result in the surface bleeding problem. The findings from this study are helpful to decrease mixture segregation and improve compaction quality of EAM deck pavement..

abstract = {One of the key steps in pavement maintenance is the fast and accurate identification of the distresses, defects, and pavement markings and ability to conduct the maintenance before the irreversible damages. Recently, convolution neural network (CNN) has emerged as a powerful tool to automatically identify the pavement cracks, where many of the CNN models take long computation time. To solve the problem, an adaptive lightweight model, named MobileCrack, is proposed in this study. MobileCrack realizes the fast computation using the following settings: (1) reduce input image size, where besides the original input images, images with a side length of 1 / 2 , 1 / 4 , 1 / 8 horizontal ellipsis of that of the original square images are also input into the model by using the resize command; (2) group convolution is used; and (3) global average pooling is used because it normally has less parameters compared with the fully connected layer. MobileCrack will then compute the combinations of different resized input images and different neural network structures, to find the optimal reduced image size and neural network structure with satisfactory accuracy using reasonable computation time. To verify the applicability of MobileCrack, 10,000 input images with size 400 x 400 are trained for the classification task of crack, sealed crack, pavement marking, and pavement matrix. Based on the computation results of combinations of images with different sizes (400 x 400 , 200 x 200 , 100 x 100 , and 50 x 50 ) and different stacking numbers of core modules n (3, 4, 5, and 6), the optimal model is determined as image size 200 x 200 and n = 4 , where the test accuracy is 0.865 within reasonable computation time (runtime = 47 ms to test one image). This optimal model will be automatically used for further tests with image size 400 x 400 for a fast computation, which realizes the lightweight adaptive goal. Results also show that the test accuracy of MobileCrack is higher than that of the AlexNet and visual geometry group (VGG), and the parameters of MobileCrack are approximately 1 / 4 of that of the classic lightweight CNN model MobileNet, which saves the storage space. It is concluded that that the proposed adaptive lightweight CNN model, MobileCrack, can be used for the fast object classification on asphalt pavement crack images.

Firstly, the validity of capacitance data measured by circular capacitance sensor for asphalt materials was analysed. Then, the moisture accumulation in asphalt materials was reconstructed and the optimal imaging method was obtained. Finally, the imaging quality under different conditions was evaluated. It is found that the capacitance values of asphalt specimens measured by circular capacitance sensor show a good 'U' curve trend. The Maxwell normalisation model and the Landweber algorithm have been empirically validated for their superior imaging quality in detecting moisture accumulation within asphalt materials. The images reconstructed in the central region appear nearly circular with no apparent defect boundaries, whereas those in the eccentric region near the electrode plate exhibit clear boundaries. Additionally, the dimensions and water content of moisture accumulation impact image quality.

The most significant characteristic of the method is that it augments objects in images, rather than augmenting images, to solve the data imbalance problem. Moreover, it employs the bounding-box form for object detection, instead of the segmentation mask form. To evaluate the method, 7635 images obtained using unmanned aerial vehicles were utilized as the original training dataset. The faster region-based convolutional neural network model trained with the augmented training dataset using the method exhibited better performance than the model trained with the original dataset. Particularly, the class with the least objects in the original dataset displayed a markedly improved performance. Thus, the method can serve as an auxiliary method for effectively augmenting real-world image datasets with an unbalanced number of objects.

abstract = {Road distresses, such as potholes and edge cracks, are not only a source of frustration to drivers but also negatively impact the economy due to damage to motor vehicles and costly ro6ad repairs. Regular and rapid pavement inspection and maintenance is vital to preventing pothole formation and growth. To improve the efficiency of maintenance and reduce the cost thereof, the Visual Surveying Platform (VSP) is being developed that will automatically detect and analyse road distresses. The VSP consists of a vehicle mounted sensor system, consisting of a high speed camera and a Global Positioning System (GPS) receiver, and an analysis and visualization software suite. The system extracts both a visual image and the coordinates of a detected road defect from recorded video and presents it in an interactive interface for use by technical experts and maintenance schedulers.The VSP automatically detects and classifies road distresses using a two-stage artificial neural network framework. Video frames first undergo hue, saturation and value (HSV) colour space conversion as well as a spatial frequency transformation before being used as inputs to the neural networks. A road detector neural network first classifies which section of the image contains the road, after which a distress detector neural network identifies those road regions containing defects. Although the VSP can be adapted to detect any type of road distress it has been trained to specifically detect potholes. An initial prototype of the VSP was designed and constructed. The prototype was also trained and tested on real-world data collected from provincial roads.

abstract = {Executive summary. Transverse cracking is a surface distress resulting from various mechanisms appearing in the pavement and their occurrence proves improper action of the structure, which, in a long run will be subject to accelerated degradation. The proper evaluation of the progress of cracking is certainly helpful in finding out the origin of this type of damage; therefore, also in the correct selection of the repair technology.The use of GPR (Ground Penetrating Radar) as an auxiliary tool in assessing the structural condition of the pavement in terms of identification of transverse cracking is not a new practice. However, it is still a complicated task due to many external factors which may distort the result or even prevent analysis of data, especially in terms of interpretation of the obtained radar images.This article presents the case study for the practical use of the method of GPR inspection of the transverse cracks structure to analyse the process of restoring transverse cracks in bituminous pavement. This procedure is based on the earlier catalogue of the GPR manifestations of the elements of deep cracking structure and requires precise synchronization of the GPR measurement with cracks observed on the pavement. Explicit manifestations are only visible in expanded cracks, where the zone of material changes in the vicinity of the cracking surface has a width of at least one decimetre. Such defects usually result from the long-lasting operating process, and their presence in the deeper layers of the structure is an evidence of breaking continuity of mechanical consistency of the foundation under the cracking line.

In this paper, the authors aim to provide a practical and reliable method to improve the soil condition under the rigid pavement of a damaged airport runway. In addition, the authors present an inspection technique with excellent results, which could be evidence for the high efficiency of the proposed improvement work. The defects included surface settlement, slurry leakage through the gaps between panels (pumping), concrete panel cracks, and so on. In this TTIA case, the underpanel grouting method (UPGM) was selected to solve these problems. Grouting flow and pressure were well controlled, and the soil in the base course was successfully reinforced, with the gaps between the concrete panels and the aggregate base course filled. Under the application of the UPGM, 7,170 grouting holes were drilled, and 1,453,723 kg of grouting materials were used to improve the soil conditions under the rigid pavement runway 23L-05R. For verification of its effectiveness, a ground-penetrating radar (GPR) and a falling weight deflectometer (FWD) were used. No noticeable deviation was observed in the GPR reports. Besides, the test results of FWD for concrete panel 71-6-the deflection ratios of the corner/center, which were tested before and after grouting-are 188% and 109%, respectively.

abstract = {Lane detection plays a vital role in making the idea of the autonomous car a reality. Traditional lane detection methods need extensive hand-crafted features and post-processing techniques, which make the models specific feature-oriented, and susceptible to instability for the variations on road scenes. In recent years, Deep Learning (DL) models, especially Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models have been proposed and utilized to perform pixel-level lane segmentation. However, most of the methods focus on achieving high accuracy while considering structured roads and good weather conditions and do not put emphasis on testing their models on defected roads, especially ones with blurry lane lines, no lane lines, and cracked pavements, which are predominant in the real world. Moreover, many of these CNN-based models have complex structures and require high-end systems to operate, which makes them quite unsuitable for being implemented in embedded devices. Considering these shortcomings, in this paper, we have introduced a novel CNN model named LLDNet based on an encoder-decoder architecture that is lightweight and has been tested in adverse weather as well as road conditions. A channel attention and spatial attention module are integrated into the designed architecture to refine the feature maps for achieving outstanding results with a lower number of parameters. We have used a hybrid dataset to train our model, which was created by combining two separate datasets, and have compared the model with a few state-of-the-art encoder-decoder architectures. Numerical results on the utilized dataset show that our model surpasses the compared methods in terms of dice coefficient, IoU, and the size of the models. Moreover, we carried out extensive experiments on the videos of different roads in Bangladesh. The visualization results exhibit that our model can detect the lanes accurately in both structured and defected roads and adverse weather conditions. Experimental results elicit that our designed method is capable of detecting lanes accurately and is ready for practical implementation.

There is a strong correlation for the arrival times and the size of the void. When the size of the voids increased, the arrival times for the top of voids become longer (e.g., approximately 8 to 10 %, depending on the size of voids). There are inversions and significant negative reflections in the ground-penetrating radar (GPR) image where the defect (air-filled void) is. In contrast, water-filled voids were detected and confirmed in case study 3 with positive peaks. The electromagnetic spectrum was able to locate voids in time. Otherwise, the voids would have grown in size and probably caused the pavement to collapse, which may have caused human casualties and property loss.

abstract = {Drone imagery is increasingly used in automated inspection for infrastructure surface defects, especially in hazardous or unreachable environments. In machine vision, the key to crack detection rests with robust and accurate algorithms for image processing. To this end, this paper proposes a deep learning approach using hierarchical convolutional neural networks with feature preservation (HCNNFP) and an intercontrast iterative thresholding algorithm for image binarization. First, a set of branch networks is proposed, wherein the output of previous convolutional blocks is half-sizedly concatenated to the current ones to reduce the obscuration in the down-sampling stage taking into account the overall information loss. Next, to extract the feature map generated from the enhanced HCNN, a binary contrast-based autotuned thresholding (CBAT) approach is developed at the post-processing step, where patterns of interest are clustered within the probability map of the identified features. The proposed technique is then applied to identify surface cracks on the surface of roads, bridges or pavements. An extensive comparison with existing techniques is conducted on various datasets and subject to a number of evaluation criteria including the average F-measure (AF(beta)) introduced here for dynamic quantification of the performance. Experiments on crack images, including those captured by unmanned aerial vehicles inspecting a monorail bridge.

Ultrasonic methods implemented in various forms of integrated ultrasonic seismic devices, such as the Portable Seismic Pavement Analyzer (PSPA), can be successfully used for such purposes. Of special interest are three techniques: ultrasonic body-wave (UBW), ultrasonic surface-wave (USW) and impact echo (IE). While the first two are used in concrete characterisation, the IE method is the primary tool in delamination detection. The primary advantage the IE method has over the current practice of chain dragging is that it allows detection of delamination zones at various stages of deterioration: from initial to progressed and developed. This is also demonstrated by finite element simulations of two probable scenarios of delamination progression. Supported by advanced three-dimensional visualisation techniques, the PSPA can be described as a bridge deck sonar device.

Due to climate changes, low quality of construction material, large flow of traffic, and heavy vehicles, road surface anomalies are increasing rapidly. Detection and repairing of these defects are necessary for the safety of drivers, passengers, and vehicles from mechanical faults. In this modern era, autonomous vehicles are an active research area that controls itself with the help of in-vehicle sensors without human commands, especially after the emergence of deep learning (DNN) techniques. A combination of sensors and DNN techniques can be useful for unmanned vehicles for the perception of their surroundings for the detection of tracks and obstacles for smooth traveling based on the deployment of artificial intelligence in vehicles. One of the biggest challenges for autonomous vehicles is to avoid the critical road defects that may lead to dangerous situations. To solve the accident issues and share emergency information, the Intelligent Transportation System (ITS) introduced the concept of vehicular network termed as vehicular ad hoc network (VANET) for achieving security and safety in a traffic flow. A novel mechanism is proposed for the automatic detection of road anomalies by autonomous vehicles and providing road information to upcoming vehicles based on Edge AI and VANET. Road images captured via camera and deployment of the trained model for road anomaly detection in a vehicle could help to reduce the accident rate and risk of hazards on poor road conditions. The techniques Residual Convolutional Neural Network (ResNet-18) and Visual Geometry Group (VGG-11) are applied for the automatic detection and classification of the road with anomalies such as a pothole, bump, crack, and plain roads without anomalies using the dataset from different online sources. The results show that the applied models performed well than other techniques used for road anomalies identification.

abstract = {This paper reports the development of an efficient evolutionary learning algorithm designed specifically for real-time embedded visual inspection applications. The proposed evolutionary learning algorithm constructs image features as a series of image transforms for image classification and is suitable for resource-limited systems. This algorithm requires only a small number of images and time for training. It does not depend on handcrafted features or manual tuning of parameters and is generalized to be versatile for visual inspection applications. This allows the system to be configured on the fly for different applications and by an operator without extensive experience. An embedded vision system, equipped with an ARM processor running Linux, is capable of performing at roughly one hundred 640 x 480 frames per second which is more than adequate for real-time visual inspection applications. As example applications, three image datasets were created to test the performance of this algorithm. The first dataset was used to demonstrate the suitability of the algorithm for visual inspection automation applications. This experiment combined two applications to make it a more challenging test. One application was for separating fertilized and unfertilized eggs. The other one was for detecting two common defects on the eggshell. Two other datasets were created for road condition classification and pavement quality evaluation. The proposed algorithm was 100% for fertilized egg detection and 98.6% for eggshell quality inspection for a combined 99.1% accuracy. It had an accuracy of 92% for the road condition classification and 100% for pavement quality evaluation. PU  - MDPI PI  - BASEL PA  - ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND},

abstract = {Fatigue damage is a major distress in pavements that has been studied extensively in various approaches, over the past two decades. It is therefore well recognized that measuring fatigue damage accumulation is difficult, time-consuming, and in many cases highly variable. Better methods for monitoring the progression of damage are thus needed for asphalt mixtures because of their heterogeneity and inherited variability. The primary objective of this research was to develop a scanning laser system that would detect changes in surface properties for the purposes of monitoring damage and characterizing the fatigue behavior of asphalt mixtures. This technique characterizes the surface state with a defect frequency parameter by rapidly scanning a laser beam along the specimen. Results were found to correlate quite well with data from other traditional mechanical tests (50% reduction in stiffness) and estimated dissipated energy approaches. This laser system is believed to offer many advantages for testing asphalt mixtures as compared with the conventional mechanical systems. The new approach provides the opportunity to quantify the microcrack formation rate and to evaluate the fatigue performance of asphalt mixtures without the need for fixtures on the sample. This system also has the potential of being used in situ for pavement monitoring. PU  - SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC PI  - THOUSAND OAKS PA  - 2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA},

abstract = {Path voting is a widely used technique for line structure detection in images. Traditional path voting, based on minimal-path, is performed to track paths based on how seeds grow. The former requires to set a starting point and an end point. Thus, the performance of minimal-path path voting depends on the initialization. However, high-quality initialization often requires human interaction, which limits its applications in practice. In this paper, a fully automatic path voting method has been proposed and applied for crack detection. The proposed path voting is performed to segment images, which partitions an image patch along the potential crack path and integrates the path to form a crack probability map. After path voting, crack seeds are sampled and modeled into a graph, and the edge weights are assigned using an attraction field algorithm. Finally, cracks are extracted by using spanning tree and tree pruning algorithms. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed path voting approach can effectively infer the cracks from 2D optic images and 3D depth images.

abstract = {During conventional highway construction, quality control and acceptance (QC/QA) are based on limited spot tests of material density at random locations which may not comprehensively represent the entire compacted area and are vulnerable to potential biases. Based on rollerintegrated positive maximum kinetic energy increment detection technique with real-time kinematic global positioning systems, this research adopted kinetic energy compaction value ( KECV ) as a real-time monitoring index for the highway compaction quality, and subsequently proposed an KECV -based assessment method to estimate the compaction quality of subgrade and pavement materials. Additionally, a global interpolation method (Green spline) was adopted to obtain estimates for both KECVs and compaction quality at any location on the work area, enabling the analysis of the passing rate of compaction quality for the entire work area. A case study on the Hengyong highway project in China indicates a highly linear correlation between the KECV and the compaction parameters, the compactness of LLL silt, and the relative density of cement -stabilized macadam; therefore, it can serve as a reliable index for monitoring compaction quality. Assessment of compaction quality on the entire work area can be fast and continuously achieved using the proposed method, which can effectively overcome the above limitation of conventional testing, timely feedback compaction information to avoid quality defects, and availably improve the construction quality of highways.

Therefore, the maintenance of highway bridge pavement has become extremely important. The main manifestation of highway bridge deck diseases is bridge deck cracks. If the bridge deck cracks are found in the early stage of damage and solved in time, it will undoubtedly greatly reduce the maintenance cost and care and ensure that the road can be driven safely. At present, the detection of highway bridge defects is mainly based on human vision, but this kind of artificial visual inspection is difficult to complete efficiently. The purpose of the article was to study image recognition techniques and measure the surface damage to bridge superstructures. It has also developed an intelligent software system that can measure and identify cracks under bridges. Aiming at the compatibility problem of wireless communication front end caused by the difference in wireless communication protocols, this study designs a high-applicability front-end control interface for wireless communication. After testing, data can be sent and received when the I/O mode rate drops to 10 Kbps. This method is severely limited and is not suitable for IoT applications with low power consumption and low frequency. It uses the SPI interface for communication and can send and receive normally at different rates, with an upper limit of 8 Mbps. This method consumes a little more pins, but the clock signal is stable, and the transmission performance can meet the needs of most applications.

abstract = {In this paper, a damage imaging method for 2-D concrete structures is proposed by employing embedded tubular piezoceramic transducers. The proposed method can image the damages when few numbers of transducers are used or less experimental data is collected. First, the time difference of arrival-based delay and sum (DAS) imaging method is adopted to improve the damage localization accuracy for concrete structural health monitoring. Compared with the conventional DAS imaging algorithm, the proposed method increases the potential number of combinations between the response signals induced by the damage in each transmitter and sensor pair, improving the signal to noise ratio of the imaging map and enhancing the performance of the defect detection and location. Second, to enable the proposed method applicable to a 2-D concrete structure (such as cement concrete pavement and shear walls), embeddable tubular lead zirconate titanate (PZT) transducers rather than conventional PZT patches are used. The new tubular PZT transducers are able to generate radially uniform stress waves in a planar concrete structure. Due to the special construction of the tubular PZT transducers, the detection aperture is significantly improved. Therefore, a few transducers are needed in contrast with the conventional PZT patches. The experimental results conducted on a concrete slab with eight embedded tubular PZT transducers demonstrate that the proposed method can predict the defect accurately and efficiently even with few transducers and less experimental data.

abstract = {In infrastructure asset management, monitoring structural condition is vital for safety and cost-efficiency. Traditional visual inspections are subjective, inconsistent, and time-consuming. Advanced automating visual inspections using digital technologies and artificial intelligence can effectively address these issues. Previous studies mainly focused on concrete structures and pavements, neglecting masonry defects and lacking publicly available datasets. In this paper, we address these gaps by introducing the "MCrack1300" dataset, annotated for bricks, broken bricks, and cracks, targeting instance segmentation. We propose two novel, automatically executable methods based on the latest visual large-scale model, the prompt-based Segment Anything Model (SAM). We fine-tune SAM's encoder using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA). The first method connects SAM's encoder to other decoders directly, while the second uses a learnable self-generating prompter. We modify the feature extractor for seamless integration of these methods with SAM's encoder. Both methods outperform the state-of-the-art models, improving benchmark results approximately 3 % across all classes and around 6 % specifically for cracks. Building on successful detection, we then propose a monocular-based method to automatically convert images into orthographic projection maps via Hough Line Transform. By incorporating known real sizes of brick units and employing Euclidean Distance Transform, we accurately estimate crack dimensions, with the error less than 10 %. Overall, we offer reliable automated solutions for masonry crack detection and size estimation, which effectively enhances the management and maintenance efficiency of masonry structural asset.

abstract = {Accurate semantic segmentation ground-truths are difficult and expensive to obtain. On the other hand, the most promising approaches to automatically tackle this task, i.e. Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), require high volumes of labeled data. We propose a new method based on deep learning for data augmentation in the context of semantic segmentation of highly-textured images. The method exploits a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to produce a semantic layout, then a texture synthesizer, based on a CNN, generates a new image according to the generated semantic layout and a reference real image taken from the training set. Even though our method is general and it can be utilized on a broad set of problems, we employed it on the real-world problem of detecting and localizing defects and cracks in road asphalts. We show how, starting from few labeled images, it is possible to augment small and long-tail datasets by producing new images with the associated semantic layouts. We prove the effectiveness of our approach by evaluating the performance of three different CNNs for semantic segmentation on the German Pavement Distress dataset and on a novel asphalt dataset collected by us. Results show a remarkable increase in performance, especially with low cardinality classes, when CNNs are trained on the augmented datasets with respect to original datasets. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

At present, image segmentation algorithms have been applied to crack analysis based on inspection images of concrete structures. The results of crack segmentation offering crack information, including length, width, and area is helpful to assist inspectors in surface inspection of concrete structures. This study proposed an algorithm of image segmentation enhancement, named morphological segmentation based on edge detection-II (MSED-II), to concrete crack segmentation. Several concrete pavement and building surfaces were imaged as the study materials. In addition, morphological operations followed by cross-curvature evaluation (CCE), an image segmentation technique of linear patterns, were also tested to evaluate their performance in concrete crack segmentation. The result indicates that MSED-II compared to CCE can lead to better quality of concrete crack segmentation. The least area, length, and width measurement errors of the concrete cracks are 5.68%, 0.23%, and 0.00%, respectively, that proves MSED-II effective for automatic measurement of concrete cracks.

abstract = {Cracks in tunnel linings are the most common tunnel defects. As early indicators of structural deterioration, cracks represent critical problems for the safety of tunnels. Several mobile tunnel inspection systems (MTISs) have been developed for tunnel crack inspection. However, due to the weak signals of cracks, these MTISs require considerable exposure time to capture high-quality tunnel images, necessitating a low travel speed. Meanwhile, traditional crack detection methods encounter difficulties in processing tunnel crack images because of their low contrast and poor continuity. To overcome these challenges, this study presents a new MTIS for fast tunnel crack inspection that consists of a novel mobile imaging module and an automatic crack detection module. The imaging module is composed of an array of high-resolution charge-coupled device (CCD) cameras, a mobile laser scanner, and a lighting array. The core of the crack detection module is a novel lightweight convolutional neural network (CNN) designed for efficient tunnel crack detection, with an effective spatial constraint strategy to guarantee crack continuity. We collected a new tunnel crack dataset consisting of 1,218 images using our mobile imaging module at a driving speed of 80 km/h. Comprehensive experiments were conducted on this dataset to evaluate the performance of our proposed network. The results demonstrate that the presented CNN can effectively detect tunnel cracks with state-of-the-art performance, achieving an F1-score greater than 0.88 and an inference speed of 17 FPS with only 3.4M model parameters.

abstract = {A method is developed to estimate the mean texture depth (MTD) value, which to some extent represents pavement quality, using measurements from a microphone mounted underneath a moving vehicle. Such measurements will include tire-generated sound that carries information about the road macrotexture as well as noise generated by the wind and vehicle. The proposed method uses principal component analysis (PCA) to differentiate important information about the road surface from noisy data while the vehicle is moving. The variations in frequency of the noise are assumed to be small compared with the variations in frequency of the signal related to the road-surface condition, which allows the PCA approach to separate noise from signals that carry information about the road-surface condition. The analysis begins with acoustic pressure measurements being made over various road-surface conditions underneath a moving vehicle. Fourier transforms are taken over various time windows and a PCA is performed over the resulting vectors. This yields a set of PC vectors representing the road-surface conditions. The frequency range of concern is from 0 to 2,000Hz, according to the amplitude of frequency spectra of collected acoustic measurement. The pavement-macrotexture depth (i.e.,MTD) is estimated by matching the PC vector set derived from unknown road conditions with one of the vector sets of known road conditions. Successful applications of this method are demonstrated by accurate estimations of the MTD of pavement directly from acoustic measurements. The results indicate that PCA is a powerful approach to eliminate the noise that is not associated with the road surface, and therefore, the PC vectors can be used to accurately match the MTD values. The PCA approach for tire-generated sound might also be used to differentiate subsurface road conditions, a precursor of many defects such as potholes and severe cracking.

However, fine-grained crack detection remains a challenge because of the slender shape, backdrop interference, and noise. We propose an automatic fine-grained crack detection algorithm based on a local enhancement self-attention mechanism and a deep semantic-guided multi-scale fusion strategy. The proposed network is built around an encoder-decoder framework. Inspired by the characteristic of global integrity and local continuity, we employ a Local Enhancement Self-Attention Block (LE Self-AB) in the encoder part. It captures the overall trend of cracks from a global perspective while focusing on the local details in the crack regions. The decoder network adopts a deep semantic-guided multi-scale fusion strategy. This strategy enables the model to benefit from both global and local information through cross-scale feature transfer and fusion. To validate the effectiveness and reliability of our approach, training and evaluation are conducted on the CrackTree260 dataset. The generalization of the model is tested on the CRKWH100 and CrackLS315 datasets.

Recent successes, driven by advances in deep learning, present a potential paradigm shift and have the potential to facilitate an automated visual inspection, even under complex environmental conditions. Thereby, convolutional neural networks (CNN) have been the de facto standard in deep-learning-based computer vision (CV) for the last 10 years. Recently, attention-based vision transformer architectures emerged and surpassed the performance of CNNs on benchmark datasets, regarding regular CV tasks, such as image classification, object detection, or segmentation. Nevertheless, despite their outstanding results, the application of vision transformers to real world visual inspection is sparse. We suspect that this is likely due to the assumption that they require enormous amounts of data to be effective. In this study, we evaluate this assumption. For this, we perform a systematic comparison of seven widely-used state-of-the-art CNN and transformer based architectures trained in three different use cases in the domain of visual damage assessment for railway freight car maintenance. We show that vision transformer models achieve at least equivalent performance to CNNs in industrial applications with sparse data available, and significantly surpass them in increasingly complex tasks.

Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) is an effective non-destructive testing (NDT) method for detecting moisture damage but its data explanation replies on human experience and subjects to labor intensive. To address this issue, an automatic detection method based on extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) combined with Bayesian hyper-parameter optimization (BHPO) was proposed to detect moisture damage area from GPR traces. High frequency GPR antenna with 2.3 GHz was used to detect the moisture damage area from simulation, laboratory and field tests, and moisture damage dataset with 7960 traces was collected. Thirty time-frequency parameters were extracted from each GPR trace, normalized to unify the three data source, and then optimized into 12 sensitive parameters by feature importance method. These 12 parameters were used to build the recognition model with XGBoost, and the model tuning parameters were optimized by BHPO. To obtain optimization model, random forest (RF) and artificial neural network (ANN) were also trained with BHPO, and compared with XGBoost model. The results indicate that performance of XGBoost model with BHPO achieves the highest accuracy and lowest time cost both in moisture damage and normal trace classification, the accuracies for moisture damage are XGBoost (96.9%) > ANN (95.6%) > RF (95.4%), respectively, and normal are XGBoost (96.5%) > RF (96.1%) and ANN (96.0%), respectively. On this basis, field tests were conducted by core samples, which verified the correct result of XGBoost model.

abstract = {Railway condition survey is limited by available time, particularly for high-speed railway due to the need to use its full capacity every day. Therefore, railway condition survey at high-speed at high-automation level becomes necessary. In addition, different from highway pavement condition assessment, safety is the primary factor for railway condition survey. The railway survey frequency is usually daily or weekly, while highway or runway pavement surveys are commonly conducted on annual basis. Rail profile measurement in the transverse direction, missing or broken fastener detection and slab surface crack identification are three primary railway survey items. Currently, manual or semi-automated methods are becoming feasible for railway condition surveys, but most of the applications are based on low resolution of data and have poor precision and accuracy. The repeatability and reliability of their analysis results cannot be assured. Based on the successful applications of 3D laser imaging for highways and runways, the team is developing a 3D digital railway surface evaluation system. This system consists of high-performance 3D laser profilers to acquire surface details in 3D of rail tracks and supporting elements and structures at resolutions finer than 1mm. A computer vision framework is being developed to acquire and process various positioning and visual data streams in a synchronous approach. This paper discusses the status of current railway survey technologies and limitations, presents the planned implementation of new 3D laser imaging technology for high-speed and complete coverage, and possible solutions to detecting rail surface defects. Especially, fastener inspection algorithm is being developed and tested. Preliminary results reveal that the proposed 3D system under development and the fastener recognition algorithms are substantially more capable in terms of high data quality and automation level for data analysis.

They are able to alert the driver in the event of a not signalized lane change, follow lane markers, detect weather phenomena like fog, snow, rain, sun glaring, automatic video cruise control, etc. Al such behaviors enhance the driving pleasure. Detecting potholes and/or debris on the road and assessing their position relative to the car wheels in order to change the suspension properties seems right around the corner. This paper introduces a mechanism used to process the pavement images to detect potholes and or road defects. Such detection done by private cars may reduce the Road Service Department's expense if submitted to them in an organized manner. Detecting a pothole in a succession of images allows tracking and wheel-hitting estimation. Such way, the control system is able to instruct the car's suspension regarding this matter.

abstract = {In this paper a new method for contour detection in grayscale images is proposed. The proposed method is based on the use of an image weight model, which allows one to estimate its pixels from the point of view of their significance for perception. In this case, the most significant pixels are those that contain characteristic features of the image, including brightness differences at the boundaries of the regions. To assess the significance of pixels, we propose a procedure for analyzing the contribution of the corresponding wavelet coefficients at different scale levels to the total energy of the image. The described method of contour detection involves building an image weight model, determining the directions of linear segments along the edges on the weight image, analyzing the significance of pixels and linking significant pixels. The advantage of the method is the high operation speed (the corresponding loop detector works on average four times faster than the Canny edge detector). In addition, the paper describes a detector of significant image areas, which is also based on the weight model. The proposed approach can be used in various systems of information processing and control based on methods and tools of computer vision, including control and navigation systems of unmanned vehicles, remote sensing of the Earth, systems for pavement defect detection, biometric systems, etc. PU  - IMAGE PROCESSING SYSTEMS INST, RUSSIAN ACAD SCIENCES PI  - MOSCOW PA  - SAMARA, MOLODOGVARDEYSKAYA ST 151, MOSCOW, 443001, RUSSIA},

abstract = {The various defects that occur on asphalt pavement are a direct cause car accidents, and countermeasures are required because they cause significantly dangerous situations. In this paper, we propose fully convolutional neural networks (CNN)-based road surface damage detection with semi-supervised learning. First, the training DB is collected through the camera installed in the vehicle while driving on the road. Moreover, the CNN model is trained in the form of a semantic segmentation using the deep convolutional autoencoder. Here, we augmented the training dataset depending on brightness, and finally generated a total of 40,536 training images. Furthermore, the CNN model is updated by using the pseudo-labeled images from the semi-supervised learning methods for improving the performance of road surface damage detection technique. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, 450 evaluation datasets were created to verify the performance of the proposed road surface damage detection, and four experts evaluated each image. As a result, it is confirmed that the proposed method can properly segment the road surface damages. PU  - MDPI PI  - BASEL PA  - ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND},

abstract = {To maintain infrastructure safety and integrity, nondestructive evaluation (NDE) technologies are often used for detection of subsurface defects and for holistic condition assessment of structures. While the rapid advances in data collection and the diversity of available sensing technologies provide new opportunities, the ability to efficiently process data and combine heterogeneous data sources to make robust decisions remains a challenge. Heterogeneous NDE measurements often conflict with one another and methods to visualize integrated results are usually developed ad hoc. In this work, a framework is presented to support fusion of multiple NDE techniques in order to improve both detection and quantification accuracy while also improving the visualization of NDE results. For data sources with waveform representations, the discrete wavelet transform (DWT) is used to extract salient features and facilitate fusion with scalar-valued NDE measurements. The description of a signal in terms of its salient features using a wavelet transform allows for capturing the significance of the original data, while suppressing measurement noise. The complete set of measurements is then fused using nonparametric machine learning so as to relax the need for Bayesian assumptions regarding statistical distributions. A novel visualization schema based on classifier confidence intervals is then employed to support holistic visualization and decision making. To validate the capabilities of the proposed methodology, an experimental prototype system was created and tested from NDE measurements of laboratory-scale bridge decks at Turner-Fairbank highway research center (TFHRC). The laboratory decks exhibit various types of artificial defects and several non-destructive tests were previously carried out by research center technicians to characterize the existing damages. The results suggest that the chosen feature extraction process, in this case the DWT, plays a critical role in classifier performance. The experimental evaluation also indicates a need for nonlinear machine learning algorithms for optimal fusion performance. In particular, support vector machines provided the most robust and consistent data fusion and defect detection capabilities. Overall, data fusion combinations are shown to provide more accurate and consistent detection results when compared to single NDE detection approaches, particularly for the detection of subsurface delamination.

abstract = {Assessment of the location and of the extension of cracking in road surfaces is important for determining the potential level of deterioration in the road overall and the infrastructure buried beneath it. Damage in a pavement structure is usually initiated in the tarmac layers, making the Rayleigh wave ideally suited for the detection of shallow surface defects. This paper presents an investigation of two surface wave methods to detect and locate top-down cracks in asphalt layers. The aim of the study is to compare the results from the well-established Multichannel Analysis of Surface Waves (MASW) and the more recent Multiple Impact of Surface Waves (MISW) in the presence of a discontinuity and to suggest the best surface wave technique for evaluating the presence and the extension of vertical cracks in roads. The study is conducted through numerical simulations alongside experimental investigations and it considers the cases for which the cracking is internal and external to the deployment of sensors. MISW is found to enhance the visibility of the reflected waves in the frequency wavenumber (f-k) spectrum, helping with the detection of the discontinuity. In some cases, by looking at the f-k spectrum obtained with MISW it is possible to extract information regarding the location and the depth of the cracking.

abstract = {This paper shows the development of a system (Hardware, Firmware and Software) focused to assess the dynamic motion factors that affect the comfort in public transportation systems. The data is collected, on-board processed and transported using the public transportation system vehicles as mobile smart sensors. Therefore, the acceleration measurement using a tri-axial accelerometer, the position detection using Global Positioning System (GPS) and the appropriate algorithms allow the system to detect rude driver styles and defects on the pavement. The firmware is composed by two algorithms. The first one is based on the detection of acceleration and Jerk magnitudes out of the comfort range, which is called Jerk-Acceleration Threshold Detection (JATD). An algorithm to compute the Jerk with comparable results to prior researches is proposed in this paper. The second algorithm, called Comfort Index with Acceleration Threshold Detection (CI-ATD), is based on the detection of acceleration values out of comfort range and the average ride comfort. The average ride comfort is supported by the recommendation of the international standard ISO2631-1. The comfort range or threshold values can be set using the user's perception. A software developed in LabVIEW (TM) interface, visualizes discomfort event in online maps for geographic location of each event. Also, the software implements road unevenness detection, which is based on the collected data analysis. The system was successful tested in a conventional bus line on its daily ride, the results reveals that most of the events are due to vertical acceleration disturbances. Also, a preliminary test indicates higher sensibility for vertical than longitudinal or transversal accelerations. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The device designed for installation in vehicles is composed of a GPS receiver and a multi-axis accelerometer. The measurement data were collected from recorded ride sessions taken place on diversified road surface roughness conditions and at varied vehicle speeds on each of examined road sections. The data were gathered for various vehicle body types and afterwards successful attempts were made in constructing the road surface classification employing the created algorithm.

abstract = {In recent years, deep learning-based crack detection methods have been widely explored and applied due to their high versatility and adaptability. In civil engineering applications, recent research on crack detection through deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) includes road pavement crack detection, bridge inspection, defects detection in shield tunnel lining, etc. Despite the increasing popularity of DCNN on crack detection, many challenges have yet to be properly addressed. For crack detection using three-dimensional (3D) range (i.e., elevation) images, disturbances such as surface variation can negatively affect the detection performance. Besides, some typical non-crack patterns such as grooves can be easily misidentified as cracks, i.e., false positives. Another issue lies in the selection of hyperparameters related with the design of a DCNN architecture. For example, the hyperparameters which are related with network structure (e.g., kernel size, network depth and width) and training (e.g., mini-batch size and learning rate) can impact the network performance to a significant extent. Therefore, they need to be properly determined for optimal performance. However, for deep learning-based roadway crack classification using laser-scanned range images, a comprehensive discussion on the hyperparameter selection/tuning has not been thoroughly performed. This study develops a hyperparameter selection process involving a series of experiments on laser-scanned range images with high diversities, investigating the optimal joint hyperparameter configuration on network structure and training for DCNN-based roadway crack classification. In a comparative study, 36 DCNN architectures with varying layouts are developed for crack classification. These architecture candidates differ in kernel sizes (e.g., 3 x 3, 7 x 7, and 11 x 11), network depths (from 5 to 8 weight layers), and widths (from 16 to 96 kernels in each convolutional layer). The 7-layer DCNN with constant 7 x 7 kernels and increasing network widths yields the highest classification performance among the proposed 36 DCNN classifiers, which may be because it can best reflect the complexity of the acquired laser-scanned roadway range images. Once the optimal architecture layout is determined, further discussion on the selection of min-batch sizes, learning rates, dropout factor and leaky rectified linear unit (LReLU) factor is performed. Experimental results show the optimal architecture with associated training configuration can achieve consistent and accurate performance, under the contamination of surface variations and grooved patterns in laser-scanned range images. Discussion on the hyperparameter selection can provide insights for the development of DCNN in similar applications using laser-scanned range images.

abstract = {Air-coupled ultrasound (ACU) is the novel emerging technique in non-destructive testing that allows removal of the coupling requirement, which significantly increases inspection speed. However, specifics of ACU caused by high impedance mismatch between air/solid interfaces set a number of limitations one of them being a requirement of two transducers in pitch-catch mode instead of a traditional single transducer in echo-mode. The goal of this paper is optimization of an ACU system geometry configuration in a specific task of single-side inspection of concrete/asphalt road pavements on the presence of subsurface delaminations. The findings provide the baseline for specification the general system setup guidelines for ACU system development under FP7 RPB HealTec project. 3D finite element modelling (FEM) is used for investigation of the impact of transducer positioning on the system's efficiency in detection of subsurface delaminations of varying depth and type. The simulation results indicated strong impact of transducer positioning on the measured response from test slabs with and without delaminations together with the significant impact of even small surface defects. Consequently, it was concluded that while ACU is sufficiently effective detection of various types of delaminations, it is highly sensitive to the surface condition and system setup.

abstract = {The detection of surface cracks or defects in roads, sewage pipes, pavements, shield tunnels lining, etc. has become a promising area of research creating a significant impact on various application domains. Maintenance and monitoring of the manufactured and natural structures are crucial for their correct functioning and integrity. An effective way to predict structural degradation and deterioration is by detecting crack formation, which defines bad health for any artificial or natural structure. Deep learning-based techniques are prominent in accurately identifying the cracks as opposed to the conventional machine learning techniques, which require large processing time and involves handcrafted features. A deep learning-based architecture for automatically detecting and segmenting the cracks in concrete based material surface is presented in the paper. The training and testing results are demonstrated on a newly created dataset consisting of 3000 images of surface cracks. We have manually annotated the cracks present in each image by drawing a bounding box and segmented mask around them. The testing results are evaluated on parameters such as crack detection accuracy, mean average precision rate (mAP), and crack detection speed. To overcome the data collection and labeling barriers, a part of the dataset is made publicly available for research purposes. The training speed and the convergence rate of the proposed algorithm are optimized by using the concept of transfer learning through freezing and unfreezing certain layers of the network. Additionally, the choice of appropriate hyperparameters for improving the model accuracy is discussed in the article. The performance of the model is evaluated against the ground truth labels generated. The AP is reported 74.156% and 93.445% at IoU (Intersection over union) threshold of 0.7 and 0.5 respectively for crack segmentation.

abstract = {In machine vision, deep learning frameworks are getting more attractive to researchers owing to their accuracy and robustness for feature extraction. However, the uncertainty in data or model has an adversary impact on the prediction and limits the performance of deep learning. To address the problem associated with uncertainty, we propose a bidirectional self-rectifying network with Bayesian modelling (BSNBM) for feature detection. First, a set of branch networks is proposed, wherein the output of previous convolutional blocks is unified and concatenated to the current ones to reduce the visual impairment in the up/down-sampling stage, taking into account the overall information loss. Further, our framework is probabilistically based on Bayesian modelling using prior knowledge. In the Bayesian model, the weight of the learnable layers are converted into distribution functions. Such conversion aims to improve robustness against outliers and therefore alleviate the overfitting issue. The proposed technique is then applied to identify surface cracks of infrastructure such as roads, bridges or pavements. Extensive comparison with existing techniques is conducted on various datasets, subject to a number of evaluation criteria. Experiments on crack images, including those captured by unmanned aerial vehicles inspecting a monorail bridge, demonstrate the merits of the proposed BSNBM architecture over existing techniques for surface defect inspection. Additional tests on extensive applications show the scalability and robustness of this model for various image processing tasks.

This paper presents requirements and tradeoffs for such antennas, as well as a brief methodology for the design process to frame the context and boundary conditions of the antenna problem. Furthermore, the paper discusses a number of planar antennas that have been designed in printed circuit board (PCB) technology using low-cost, glass-reinforced epoxy laminate sheets such as FR4.The ultra-wide-band operation of antennas, along with other key parameters such as gain and beam width, is very important in the design of a useful GPR antenna for air-coupled operation. The interconnected relationship between antenna parameters limits the designs and constrains the upper bounds of the performance that can be achieved. Regulatory specifications such as FCC compliance create additional burden on the specifications and requirements.A rounded bowtie antenna, a slotted bowtie antenna and two types of Vivaldi antenna are designed, simulated, fabricated, and characterized. All are intended to operate within the 1.1-3.5 GHz frequency band and benefit from compact size while providing high gain to allow for the detection of pavement layers and rebar in bridge decks to a depth of up to 2 feet. In-field measurements of the antennas, together with the GPR system, are presented for static testing scenarios such as buried rebar in a sand box and concrete slab. The antenna testing over the sandbox and concrete slab demonstrates the great potential of utilizing the proposed antennas in air-coupled GPR systems, especially the compact rounded bowtie and slotted bowtie antennas.

abstract = {Real-time road quality monitoring, involves using technologies to collect data on the conditions of the road, including information on potholes, cracks, and other defects. This information can help to improve safety for drivers and reduce costs associated with road damage. Traditional methods are time-consuming and expensive, leading to limited spatial coverage and delayed responses to road conditions. With the widespread use of smartphones and ubiquitous computing technologies, data can be collected from built-in sensors of mobile phones and in-vehicle video, on a large scale. This has raised the question of how these data can be used for road pothole detection and has significant practical relevance. Current methods either use acceleration sequence classification techniques, or image recognition techniques based on deep learning. However, accelerometer-based detection has limited coverage and is sensitive to the driving speed, while image recognition-based detection is highly affected by ambient light. To address these issues, this study proposes a method that utilizes the fusion of accelerometer data and in-vehicle video data, which is uploaded by the participating users. The preprocessed accelerometer data and intercepted video frames, were then encoded into real-valued vectors, and projected into the public space. A deep learning-based training approach was used to learn from the public space and identify road anomalies. Spatial density-based clustering was implemented in a multi-vehicle scenario, to improve reliability and optimize detection results. The performance of the model is evaluated with confusion matrix-based classification metrics. Real-world vehicle experiments are carried out, and the results demonstrate that the proposed method can improve accuracy by 6% compared to the traditional method. Consequently, the proposed method provides a novel approach for large-scale pavement anomaly detection. PU  - MDPI PI  - BASEL PA  - ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND},

With the development of multi-channel 3D ground penetrating radar (GPR) systems, GPR has become a routine method for inspecting the subsurface conditions of roads. However, the reflection characteristics of hidden defects in 3D GPR results have not been well studied due to the complexity of urban road structures. Consequently, accurately detecting all subsurface defects in GPR survey areas remains challenging. In this paper, numerical models of road structures with typical types of hidden defects are constructed, and their reflection characteristics in GPR B-scan profiles and C-scan depth slices are analyzed. Then, the field results obtained using a car-mounted 3D GPR system are presented to confirm the reflection characteristics of these hidden defects. Finally, the reflections of manhole covers and underground pipelines, which are the most prevalent forms of clutter in GPR images in urban environments, are compared with those of hidden defects. The findings of this paper will facilitate the accurate interpretation of field 3D GPR data for road inspections and the mitigation of road collapse accidents.

abstract = {The future of autonomous driving is slowly approaching, but there are still many steps to take before it can become a reality. It is crucial to pay attention to road infrastructure, because without it, intelligent vehicles will not be able to operate reliably, and it will never be possible to dispense of driver's control. This paper presents the work carried out for the detection of road markings damage using computer vision techniques. This is a complex task for which there are currently not many papers and large image sets in the literature. This study uses images from the public Road Damage Detection dataset for the D44 defect and also provides 971 new labelled images for Spanish roads. For this purpose, three detectors based on deep learning architectures (Faster RCNN, SDD and EfficientDet) have been used and single-source and mixed-source models have been studied to find the model that best fits the target images. Finally, F1-score values reaching 0.929 and 0.934 have been obtained for Japanese and Spanish images respectively which improve the state-of-the-art results by 25%. It can be concluded that the results of this study are promising, although the collection of many more images will be necessary for the scientific community to continue advancing in the future in this field of research.

abstract = {The original pavement surface must meet roughness specifications to ensure the quality of resurfacing or reconstruction projects. Therefore, it is crucial to use appropriate roughness detection equipment and evaluation indicators to represent the surface's roughness characteristics. This study adopted the shot blasting and milling machine to treat the cement concrete base surface at four levels increased with the shot blasting times and texture depth respectively. The 3D laser detection equipment with 0.55 mm measurement accuracy captured raw data from the surface. The 8-neighbor cyclic filling algorithm was applied to correct invalid data, followed by Butterworth filtering to reduce noise. The Kriging interpolation method was utilized to reconstruct the 3D model of the surface. The surface roughness characteristics were assessed through three categories of indicators: geometric, spectral, and fractal indicators. A comprehensive roughness index (TPCA) based on these indicators was performed using the principal component analysis. The three categories of roughness indicators exhibit varying degrees of change with the variation of the treatment parameters. At the second level of shot-blasting treatment, the TPCA reached its peak, showing a 240.1 % increase over the control group. Under the fourth milling treatment level, TPCA achieved its highest recorded value, marking a 1357.8% increase compared to the control.

abstract = {Vision is one of the most advanced and important sensory input in humans. However, many people have vision problems due to birth defects, uncorrected errors, work nature, accidents, and aging. The white cane and guide dog are the most widely used means of navigation for the vision-impaired. With advancements in technology, electronic devices have been created using different sensors and technologies to help navigate the blind. Electronic Travel Aids (ETAs) assist in navigating a person by collecting information about the environment and relaying this information in a form that allows a blind or vision-impaired person to understand the nature of the environment. However, there is still a lack of devices to detect potholes and uneven pavements, which inhibits mobility after dark. This pilot study proposes a computer vision based pothole and uneven surface detection approach to assist blind people in meeting their mobility needs. The system includes projecting laser patterns, recording the patterns through a monocular video, analyzing the patterns to extract features and then providing path cues for the blind user. With over 9 0 % accuracy in detecting potholes, the proposed system aims to assist blind people in real-time navigation. PU  - IEEE PI  - NEW YORK PA  - 345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA},

abstract = {Condition and deterioration of public and private infrastructure is an issue that directly affects the majority of the world population. In this paper we propose the application of a Residual Neural Network to automatically detect road and pavement surface cracks. The high amount of variance in the texture of the surface and variation in illumination levels makes the task of automatically detecting defects within public and private infrastructure a difficult task. The system developed utilises a feature pyramid core with an underlying feed-forward ResNet architecture. The output from the feature pyramid then feeds into two sub-networks. One sub-network associates a class with the output from the feature pyramid. The other sub-network regresses the offset from each of the output bounding boxes of the feature pyramid to the corresponding ground truth boxes during training. The network was trained on real world data from an already established dataset. The data used to train and test on is very limited, due to the lack of available road crack datasets in the public domain. Despite the limited amount of data, the proposed method achieves a very positive results with minimal error. PU  - IEEE PI  - NEW YORK PA  - 345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA},

abstract = {Concrete delamination is a common type of defects in concrete bridge decks and rigid pavements. While it was reported that ground-penetrating radar (GPR) was able to visualize such types of defects in many instances, it is still unclear about the conditions of success for that application. In such a context, this study aimed to explore various factors that might affect the detectability of concrete delamination in GPR images/signals. In terms of methodology, the study was conducted using both synthetic data generated from a GPR simulation program, and real data collected on a concrete slab specimen. The analysis of such image data revealed the following. First, there is always a waveform reflected from concrete delamination. However, its strength is affected mainly by the thickness of the delamination, the material (air or water) within it, and the peak (most energetic) frequency of the emitted signal. Second, the depth of delamination and its location relative to neighboring steel bars might impact its detectability in GPR images. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

abstract = {The assessment of the location and the extension of cracks in roads is important for determining the potential level of deterioration in the road overall and in the infrastructure buried beneath it. Damage in a pavement structure is usually initiated in the tarmac layers, making Rayleigh waves ideally suited for the detection of shallow surface defects. In this work, the differences between the spectral images obtained with the Multichannel Analysis of Surface Waves (MASW) and the Multiple Impact of Surface Waves (MISW) are suggested for the first time to detect, locate and evaluate surface-breaking cracks in dispersive material, i.e. roads. Assessment of crack in roads is usually performed assuming constant velocity and non-dispersive behaviour of the material tested, limiting this approach to the very shallow layer of the road. The road is here holistically treated as a dispersive medium, supporting a paradigm-shifting approach to in situ crack evaluation. It is shown that surface-breaking cracks influence the content of the spectral images obtained with these two acoustic imaging techniques. Their differences are used for the first time for the in situ evaluation of the presence, the location and, in some cases, the extension of vertical cracks in roads. The study is conducted through numerical simulations, alongside experimental investigations. The paper describes two cases for which the cracking is internal and then external to the deployment of sensors. The method proposed in this paper proved to be successful for the in situ evaluation of cracks in asphalt, tackling the heterogeneities and dispersive behaviour of the material tested.

One of the major causes of premature pavement failure is the moisture damage of the asphalt concrete layer. Many variables affect the amount of water damage in the asphalt concrete layer such as the type of aggregate, bitumen, mixture design and construction, level of traffic, environment, and the additive properties that are introduced to the bitumen, aggregate or bitumen-aggregate mixture.This study is aimed to determine the effect of additives Such as hydrated lime as well as elastomeric (SBS) and plastomeric (EVA) polymer modified bitumen (PMB) on the stripping potential and moisture susceptibility characteristics of hot mix asphalt (HMA) containing different types of aggregate (basalt-limestone aggregate mixture and limestone aggregate). The stripping properties and moisture susceptibility characteristics of the samples have been evaluated by means of captured images and the Nicholson stripping test (ASTM D 1664) as well as the modified Lottman test (AASHTO T 283), respectively.The results indicated that hydrated lime addition and polymer modification increased the resistance of asphalt mixtures to the detrimental effect of water. Moreover, it was found out that samples prepared with SBS PMB exhibited more resistance to water damage compared to samples prepared with EVA PMB. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The current methods, involving on-site visual inspections, have proven to be costly, time-consuming, labor-intensive, and highly subjective for assessing the safety and integrity of civil infrastructures. Mobile and stationary LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) devices have significant potential for damage detection, as the scans provide detailed geometric information about the structures being evaluated. This paper reviews the recent developments for LiDAR-based structural health monitoring, in particular, for detecting cracks, deformation, defects, or changes to structures over time. In this regard, mobile laser scanning (MLS) and terrestrial laser scanning (TLS), specific to structural health monitoring, were reviewed for a wide range of civil infrastructure systems, including bridges, roads and pavements, tunnels and arch structures, post-disaster reconnaissance, historical and heritage structures, roofs, and retaining walls.

abstract = {The Impact-Echo (IE) test is an effective method for determining the presence, depth, and area of cracks in concrete as well as the dimensions of the sound concrete without defects. In addition, shallow delamination can be measured by confirming a flexural mode in the low-frequency region. Owing to the advancement of non-contact sensors and automated measurement equipment, the IE test can be measured at multiple points in a short period. To analyze and distinguish a large volume of data, applying supervised learning (SL) associated with various contemporary algorithms is necessary. However, SL has limitations due to the difficulty in accurate labeling for increased volumes of test data, and reflection of new specimen characteristics, and it is necessary to apply semi-supervised learning (SSL) to overcome them. This study analyzes the accuracy and evaluates the applicability of a model trained with SSL rather than SL using the data from the air-coupled IE test based on dynamic preconditions. For the detection of delamination defects, the dynamic behavior-based flexural mode was identified, and 21 features were extracted in the time and frequency domains. Three principal components (PCs) such as the real moment, real RMS, and imaginary moment were derived through principal component analysis (PCA). PCs were identical in slab, pavement, and deck. In the case of SSL considering a dynamic behavior, the accuracy increased by 7-8% compared with SL, and it could categorize good, fair, and poor status to a higher level for actual structures. The applicability of SSL to the IE test was confirmed, and because the crack progress varies under field conditions, other parameters must be considered in the future to reflect this.

The deterioration of reinforced concrete structure such as elevated service reservoir is major problem in many countries of the world. Many of the existing water tanks in service today are inadequate to need the present water demand. To ensure safe durable service and selecting the most appropriate repair strategy it is essential to perform in situ inspection for a distressed concrete structure.

That said, the objectives of this paper are (1) to provide a brief review of the historical development of these powerful devices and (2) to provide a comprehensive assessment of their capabilities in imaging internal entities and structural defects. Regarding the former, the paper presents the context that gave birth to DPC technology and different generations of ultrasonic shear wave devices for concrete inspection. For the latter, one of the state-of-the-art ultrasonic shear wave devices (MIRA 3D) was used to collect data on concrete specimens with different built-in flaws/defects. Those data are then visualized with a commonly used data processing algorithm, the so-called synthetic aperture focusing technique (SAFT). Finally, based on the resulting images, the capabilities of the device are discussed in detail for each concrete imaging problem. A main limitation of ultrasonic shear wave technique for concrete inspection is that it requires a significant amount of time and effort for data collection.

abstract = {When concrete paver is chosen as a material for paving, one of the most important requirements of the supplier is its surface texture. Surface texture is determined by both the concrete mix design and the type and setting of vibrocompression equipment used for production, which can generate different amounts of bugholes. Unlike other properties, such as compressive strength, there is currently no available method for evaluating surface texture in pavers. There are currently some proposed methods for the assessment and detection of defects in asphalt and concrete pavements, but there is no consensus on their suitability for being easily used to classify pavers regarding their surface texture. The choice of a supplier is still normally based on the visual assessment of this characteristic in samples provided by the supplier himself, and there is no guarantee that these samples will be representative of the material to be delivered at the job site. The present study proposes a method for the evaluation and classification of pavers' surface texture based on the standard deviation obtained in the frequency histogram of digital grayscale images of pavers. The study proves that it is possible to use flatbed scanners to evaluate the surface texture if a previous image calibration using reflective standard targets is undertaken. The results obtained using the proposed method for the classification of samples possessing different surface textures correlate very well with the visual assessments of production experts. Additionally, it is a simple, fast, and low-cost method, and the results are not influenced by the operator. Finally, a classification of pavers' surface texture based on digital image processing (DIP) results is proposed. (C) 2015 American Society of Civil Engineers.

The terrestrial laser scanner (TLS) will be employed in this project for collecting data, used for monitoring purposes. LiDAR camera mounted on moving vehicle generating 3D point cloud is used for monitoring purpose. Poorly maintained roads result in lower productivity, higher fuel consumption, increased mechanical wear, hazardous operating conditions, driver discomfort, and higher rolling resistances. Road management agencies suffer with pavement repair methods and the finances to keep the existing road networks in good working order. The goal of this research work is to create a low-cost smart road health monitoring system that uses camera-based monitoring and smart phone sensors to identify the road section for maintenance. We have discovered that using accelerometers for pothole detection is ideal for this application. The road patches or pot holes for 2 km area of the RGIPT campus using accelerometer is being done. The smart phone will upload the position and any kind of undulated road surface to the cloud when the vehicle passes over it. Use of accelerometer may detect internal damage of the pavements before it appears on the top surface of the road. When other vehicles move towards an irregular road surface, the cloud will issue an undulated road surface reminder to make sure that the vehicle may safely and smoothly drive through the area. The system is simply dependent on a single phone setting and uses raw accelerometer measurements, which can record irregular driving or quick brakes. The data in this system are collected from the mobile phone and sensor for monitoring and forecasting of road surface. So, every pavement defect has different classification and treatment approach, as well as severity levels.

Conventional inspection techniques like ground-penetrating radar (GPR) are effective but expensive and time-consuming. Alternatively, laser dynamic deflectometer (LDD) has emerged as a cost-efficient tool capable of real-time measurements; however, its reliability for detecting subsurface defects in urban roadways remains unclear. This research investigates the feasibility and efficacy of LDD for the rapid identification of subsurface cavities within urban road networks. A case study was conducted in Longgang District, involving comprehensive inspections using both LDD and GPR, with cavities delineated based on GPR data. Chi-square tests revealed a positive correlation between deflection anomalies detected by LDD and the subsurface cavities identified by GPR, with a stronger correlation on main roads. Deflection values significantly increased as the distance between the top of the cavity and road surface decreased, suggesting that LDD measurements can effectively predict the condition of underlying cavities. A moderate-to-strong correlation was found between LDD deflection anomalies and GPR reflection intensity, validating the integration of these technologies for reliable cavity inspections. This research demonstrates that the LDD is a feasible and effective method for large-scale urban road inspections, offering the potential for timely and early warning of ground collapse.

abstract = {This contribution presents the results of the "SENSOVO" project initiated by the Flanders Institute for Mobility (VIM), executed by the University of Antwerp (UAntwerp), the Flemish Institute for Technological Research (VITO) and the Belgian Road Research Centre (BRRC), and supported by several other parties.Both road users and road managers could benefit from massively, continuously, automatized collecting of information on road surface distress (potholes, cracking, subsidence,.) by a fleet of vehicles equipped with low-cost sensors. Road users could have immediate information on road conditions while road managers could get year-round insight on the general performance of the road network in addition to the data they obtain from annual inspections with specialized monitoring devices.The project's objective was to investigate possibilities of road surface distress detection using data collected by a fleet of vehicles. Two scenarios were considered: a large fleet of ordinary cars and trucks transmitting collected relevant sensor data already available on the CAN-bus in such vehicles; a vehicle, equipped with one or more Time-of-Flight cameras (ToF).Data on the CAN-bus were collected using either a CAN-logger that sends its data to a central server using GPRS where it is processed for road surface distress detection, or using an OBD scan-tool that sends its data using Bluetooth to a smartphone that already processes the data into detection events, forwarding only these to a central server. The performances were tested by UAntwerp and VITO. A simple computation developed by UAntwerp on the speed of all four wheels and on the vertical accelerations often allows indicating road distress. Either the CAN data-logger or the smartphone delivers the GPS location of the event. Several cars equipped with this technology sent their observations to a central database.Several ToF cameras were benchmarked by UAntwerp. Road data were collected at 40km/h and 40frames/s with ToF-cameras of brands Mesa and Fotonic. Several image processing algorithms dedicated to the identification of road distress on a flow of images were developed by UAntwerp. It has been demonstrated that several types of "unevenness" of the road surface (including potholes) can be detected. Some ToF-camera observations were added to the central database.The BRRC developed and implemented an algorithm for treatment and interpretation of the collected events in the central database using the ArcGIS software, simulating both sending out alerts to road users and providing daily "quality scores" for each road section in the network to the road manager. For this, the network was defined from a geographical map provided by the Flanders Geographical Information Agency (FGIA/AGIV). As soon as "enough" observations are made taking into account the frequency of observations in time, the defect is considered as real and will be reported. When the defect is no longer observed, it is considered as being repaired. A "score" for each road section was computed daily, from the amount of defects present that day.The SENSOVO project along other recent research projects worldwide delivers a proof-of-concept for fleet probing of road surface distress.

abstract = {Cracks undermine the structural health of transportation infrastructure. Machine vision-based surface crack analysis is to process infrastructure inspection data collected by imaging devices for identifying the presence, location, and extent of cracks, classifying the corresponding severity levels, and eventually predicting their growth. Unlike the fragmented qualitative discussions on machine vision-based crack analysis methods in existing studies, this paper reviews the state of the art and practice of various machine vision solutions under different operating conditions in a fine-grained quantitative way, systematically describing the strengths and limitations of deep learning over other solutions. Moreover, the applicability assessment is implemented to describe the deployment and optimization of deep learning in five crack analysis tasks: image classification, object detection, pixel segmentation, geometric scale quantification, and growth prediction. At last, the challenges faced and corresponding breakthrough directions are summarized, respectively, driving further development of deep learning to assist more sophisticated maintenance decisions.

abstract = {Transportation infrastructure serves as the backbone of societal functionality. As aging road networks present increasing challenges, effective monitoring and maintenance become imperative. In this context, this article explores the integration of non-destructive techniques for monitoring and assessing damaged road sections. The work emphasizes the importance of leveraging the complementarity between non-destructive techniques to gain a holistic understanding of damaged road sections' structural integrity. Through the combination of these techniques, structural issues and underlying causes can be identified, as well as to develop maintenance and rehabilitation strategies.A case study of a critical section of the national road N-541 in Pontevedra, Spain, illustrates the application of this integration. First, Interferometry Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) technology revealed points of interest. Four different cases, with two different methods: Scatterer Interferometry (PSI) and Quasi-PS (QPS) were used, to minimize uncertainty. Then, Global Positioning System (GPS) data, together with Laser Imaging Detection and Ranging (LiDAR), were used to create Digital Elevation Models (DEM). Finally, Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) was useful to create a data cloud of possible subsurface damages. Machine learning technique (clustering) was applied to the GPR data to assist in defect depth analysis, further improving understanding and knowledge. The integration of complementary non-destructive methods offers a comprehensive framework for advancements in road infrastructure analysis and maintenance strategies, thus contributing to decision-makers to enhance transportation infrastructures' resilience and longevity.

abstract = {Nowadays, asphalt road has dominated highways around the world. Among various defects of asphalt road, cracks have been paid more attention, since cracks often cause major engineering and personnel safety incidents. Current manual crack inspection methods are time-consuming and labor-intensive, and most segmentation methods cannot detect cracks at the pixel level. This paper proposes an intelligent segmentation and measurement model based on the modified Mask R-CNN algorithm to automatically and accurately detect asphalt road cracks. The model proposed in this paper mainly includes a convolutional neural network (CNN), an optimized region proposal network (RPN), a region of interest (RoI) Align layer, a candidate area classification network and a Mask branch of fully convolutional network (FCN). The ratio and size of anchors in the RPN are adjusted to improve the accuracy and efficiency of segmentation. Soft non-maximum suppression (Soft-NMS) algorithm is developed to improve the segmentation accuracy. A dataset including 8,689 images (512 x 512 pixels) of asphalt cracks is established and the road crack is manually marked. Transfer learning is used to initialize the model parameters in the training process. To optimize the model training parameters, multiple comparison experiments are performed, and the test results show that the mean average precision (mAP) value and F1-score of the optimal trained model are 0.952 and 0.949. Subsequently, the robustness verification test and comparative test of the trained model are conducted and the topological features of the crack are extracted. Then, the damage area, length and average width of the crack are measured automatically and accurately at pixel level. More importantly, this paper develops an automatic crack detection platform for asphalt roads to automatically extract the number, area, length and average width of cracks, which can significantly improve the crack detection efficiency for the road maintenance industry.

abstract = {Today, the most commonly used civil infrastructure inspection method is based on a visual assessment conducted by certified inspectors following prescribed protocols. However, the increase in aggressive environmental and load conditions, coupled with the achievement of many structures of the life-cycle end, has highlighted the need to automate damage identification and satisfy the number of structures that need to be inspected. To overcome this challenge, this paper presents a method for automating concrete damage classification using a deep convolutional neural network. The convolutional neural network was designed after an experimental investigation of a wide number of pretrained networks, applying the transfer-learning technique. Training and validation were conducted using a database built with 1352 images balanced between "undamaged", "cracked", and "delaminated" concrete surfaces. To increase the network robustness compared to images in real-world situations, different image configurations have been collected from the Internet and on-field bridge inspections. The GoogLeNet model, with the highest validation accuracy of approximately 94%, was selected as the most suitable network for concrete damage classification. The results confirm that the proposed model can correctly classify images from real concrete surfaces of bridges, tunnels, and pavement, resulting in an effective alternative to the current visual inspection techniques.

abstract = {Using deep learning to detect road damage can significantly improve the effectiveness of road maintenance. To promote the development of road damage detection, we construct a high-resolution road damage data set named Asphalt Road Surface Disease Dataset(ARSDD), comprising 2297 images used in a real-world project. The annotation process is under the guidance of the road maintenance department, and it has more accurate labels and appropriate damage types. Most current road damage detection models are anchor-based, where one anchor corresponds to one sample. Therefore, these models are primarily limited by the setting of pre-defined anchors. Road damages have more extreme aspect ratios and scales than natural objects, and the general settings of anchors are inappropriate for road damage. In this paper, we propose a road damage detection model based on an improved adaptive training sample selection strategy, which can reduce manual anchor settings and is suitable for road damage detection. Moreover, as slight road damages tend to lose information during down-sampling, a cross-layer attention feature pyramid network is designed to compensate for this degradation in the spatial dimensions. While testing the ARSDD dataset, we find that the evaluation criterion for general object detection is unsuitable for road damage detection and propose a new post-processing method and diagonal-based evaluation criterion according to the characteristics of road damage. We validate our model using the 2018 Road Damage Dataset and our proposed dataset, and the results demonstrate the superiority of our model in road damage detection.Note to Practitioners-This paper was motivated by the problem of road damage detection, which is the key of intelligent road maintenance system. We comprehensively analyze the shortcomings of current publicly available content about road damage detection, including detection datasets, algorithms and evaluation metrics. Correspondingly, we first construct a road damage dataset from the real-world project, which contains six common categories of disease and is annotated under the guidance of the road maintenance department. Then we propose a detection model based on computer vision technology to improve the accuracy of damage detection. Finally, we propose a new post-processing method and a diagonal-based evaluation criterion based on the detection boxes. Any practitioner working on pavement inspection systems can use our released dataset and method to build a better-performing automated inspection system. In future research, we will try more refined inspection schemes and evaluation indicators, such as meshing the road surface images and evaluating the quality of the road based on the inspection results of each mesh.

These challenges have instigated research in the application of advanced machine learning algorithms such as deep learning to help with diagnostic and prescriptive analysis of causes and preventive measures. However, the publicity created by tech firms like Google, Facebook and Amazon about Artificial Intelligence and applications to unstructured data is not the end of the field. There abound many applications of deep learning, particularly within the construction sector in areas such as site planning and management, health and safety and construction cost prediction, which are yet to be explored. The overall aim of this article was to review existing studies that have applied deep learning to prevalent construction challenges like structural health monitoring, construction site safety, building occupancy modelling and energy demand prediction. To the best of our knowledge, there is currently no extensive survey of the applications of deep learning techniques within the construction industry. This review would inspire future research into how best to apply image processing, computer vision, natural language processing techniques of deep learning to numerous challenges in the industry.

abstract = {Sensor-based agriculture monitoring systems have limited outcomes on the detection or counting of vegetables from agriculture fields due to the utilization of either conventional color transformations or machine learning-based methods. To overcome these limitations, this research is aimed at proposing an IoT-based smart agriculture monitoring system with multiple algorithms such as detection, quantification, ripeness checking, and detection of infected vegetables. This paper presents smart agriculture monitoring systems for Internet of Things (IoT) applications. The CHT has been applied to detect and quantify vegetables from the agriculture field. Using color thresholding and color segmentation techniques, defected vegetables have also been detected. A machine learning method-convolutional neural network (CNN) has been used for the development and implementation of all algorithms. A comparison between traditional methods and CNN has been simulated in MATLAB to find out the optimal method for its implementation in this agricultural monitoring system. Compared to the traditional methods, the CNN is the optimal method in this research work which performed better over the previously developed algorithms with an accuracy of more than 90%. As an example (case study), a tomato field in Chittagong, Bangladesh, was chosen where a camera-mounted mobile robot captured images from the agriculture field for which the proposed IoT-based smart monitoring system was developed. This system will benefit farmers through the digitally monitored output at an agriculture field in Bangladesh as well as in Malaysia. Since this proposed smart IoT-based system is still driven by bulky, costly, and limited powered sensors, in a future work, for the required power of sensors, this research work is aimed at the design and development of an energy harvester (hybrid) (HEH) based on ultralow power electronics circuits to generate the required power of sensors.

abstract = {In the management of road networks, it is often desired to know the condition of individual road sections, which is approximated using the values of condition indicators. The values of these indicators can be used, for example, to determine whether an intervention should be executed on the road sections in the upcoming year, or to predict the future condition of the road sections. Unfortunately, a common problem when working with these data is that there are numerous road sections where no information is available. This can happen either due to errors made during the inspection campaigns themselves or due to using multiple independent sets of geographical information system (GIS) indexed data, when the sets are recorded as noncoincidental GIS shapes. It is of interest to the road manager to estimate the values of the missing condition indicators as best as possible. In this paper, an investigation of the ability to estimate values of road section indicators based on their spatial correlation is presented. The investigation is done by estimating the values of condition indicators for surface defects, and longitudinal and transversal unevenness exploiting the spatial correlation between them, on the Swiss national highway network. It is shown that the values of road section indicators can be estimated based on their spatial correlation with reasonably high levels of accuracy. The variation of the predictive ability per condition indicator is shown. PU  - ASCE-AMER SOC CIVIL ENGINEERS PI  - RESTON PA  - 1801 ALEXANDER BELL DR, RESTON, VA 20191-4400 USA},

abstract = {Quality assessment in industrial applications is often carried out through visual inspection, usually performed or supported by human domain experts. However, the manual visual inspection of processes and products is error-prone and expensive. It is therefore not surprising that the automation of visual inspection in manufacturing and maintenance is heavily researched and discussed. The use of artificial intelligence as an approach to visual inspection in industrial applications has been considered for decades. Recent successes, driven by advances in deep learning, present a possible paradigm shift and have the potential to facilitate automated visual inspection, even under complex environmental conditions. For this reason, we explore the question of to what extent deep learning is already being used in the field of automated visual inspection and which potential improvements to the state of the art could be realized utilizing concepts from academic research. By conducting an extensive review of the openly accessible literature, we provide an overview of proposed and in-use deep-learning models presented in recent years. Our survey consists of 196 open-access publications, of which 31.7% are manufacturing use cases and 68.3% are maintenance use cases. Furthermore, the survey also shows that the majority of the models currently in use are based on convolutional neural networks, the current de facto standard for image classification, object recognition, or object segmentation tasks. Nevertheless, we see the emergence of vision transformer models that seem to outperform convolutional neural networks but require more resources, which also opens up new research opportunities for the future. Another finding is that in 97% of the publications, the authors use supervised learning techniques to train their models. However, with the median dataset size consisting of 2500 samples, deep-learning models cannot be trained from scratch, so it would be beneficial to use other training paradigms, such as self-supervised learning. In addition, we identified a gap of approximately three years between approaches from deep-learning-based computer vision being published and their introduction in industrial visual inspection applications. Based on our findings, we additionally discuss potential future developments in the area of automated visual inspection. PU  - MDPI PI  - BASEL PA  - ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND},

abstract = {Cracks and bugholes (surface air voids) are common factors that affect the quality of concrete surfaces, so it is necessary to detect them on concrete surfaces. To improve the accuracy and efficiency of the detection, this research implements a novel deep learning technique based on DeepLabv3+ to detect cracks and bugholes on concrete surfaces. Firstly, in the decoder, the 3 x 3 convolution of the feature fusion part is improved to a 3-layer depth separable convolution to reduce the information loss during up sampling. Secondly, the original expansion rate combination is changed from 1, 6, 12, 18 to 1, 2, 4, 8 to improve the segmentation effect of the model on the image. Thirdly, a weight value is added to each channel of the Atrous Spatial Pyramid Polling (ASSP) module, and the feature maps that contribute significantly to the target prediction are learned and screened. To use this method, a database is built containing 16, 662, 256 x 256 pixel images of bugholes and cracks on concrete surfaces. The two defects included in those images are labeled manually. The DeepLabv3+ architecture is then modified, trained, validated and tested using this database. A strategy of model-based transfer learning is applied to optimize and accelerate the learning efficiency of the model. The weights and biases of the Xception part of the model are initialized by the pretrained backbones.
