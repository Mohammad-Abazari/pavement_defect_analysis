Advanced pavement inspection systems such as LCMS (Laser Crack Measurement System) can automatically detect the presence of simple defects (e.g. ruts) using 3D lasers. However, such systems still require manual involvement to complete the detection of more complex pavement defects (e.g. patches). This paper proposes an automatic patch detection system using object detection techniques. To our knowledge, this is the first time state-of-the-art object detection models (Faster RCNN, and SSD MobileNet-V2) have been used to detect patches inside images acquired by 3D profiling sensors. Results show that the object detection model can successfully detect patches inside such images and suggest that our proposed approach could be integrated into the existing pavement inspection systems. The contribution of this paper are (1) an automatic pavement patch detection model for images acquired by 3D profiling sensors and (2) comparative analysis of RCNN, and SSD MobileNet-V2 models for automatic patch detection.					17th International Joint Conference on Computer Vision, Imaging and Computer Graphics Theory and Applications (VISIGRAPP) / 17th International Conference on Computer Vision Theory and Applications (VISAPP)17th International Joint Conference on Computer Vision, Imaging and Computer Graphics Theory and Applications (VISIGRAPP) / 17th International Conference on Computer Vision Theory and Applications (VISAPP)	FEB 06-08, 2022FEB 06-08, 2022		ELECTR NETWORKELECTR NETWORK	11	0	0	0	0	0	11			2184-4321		978-989-758-555-5									Technol Univ, Dept Comp Sci, Dublin, IrelandPavement Management Serv Ltd, Galway, Ireland	Technol UnivPavement Management Serv Ltd			2022-04-22	WOS:000777505000041

To minimize damage to vehicles from pavement defects or provide the corresponding comfortable ride promotion strategy later, in this study, we developed a pavement defect detection system using a deep learning perception scheme for implementation on Xilinx Edge AI platforms. To increase the detection distance and accuracy of pavement defects, two cameras with different fields of view, at 70 degrees and 30 degrees, respectively, were used to capture the front views of a car, and then the YOLOv3 (you only look once, version 3) model was employed to recognize the pavement defects, such as potholes, cracks, manhole covers, patches, and bumps. In addition, to promote continuous pavement defect recognition rate, a tracking-via-detection strategy was employed, which first detects pavement defects in each frame and then associates them to different frames using the Kalman filter method. Thus, the average detection accuracy of the pothole category could reach 71%, and the miss rate was about 29%. To confirm the effectiveness of the proposed detection strategy, experiments were conducted on an established Taiwan pavement defect image dataset (TPDID), which is the first dataset for Taiwan pavement defects. Moreover, different AI methods were used to detect the pavement defects for quantitative comparative analysis. Finally, a field-programmable gate-array-based edge computing platform was used as an embedded system to implement the proposed YOLOv3-based pavement defect detection system; the execution speed reached 27.8 FPS while maintaining the accuracy of the original system model.									15	0	0	0	0	0	17				2076-3417										Feng Chia Univ, Dept Automat Control Engn, Taichung 40724, TaiwanNatl Taipei Univ Technol, Grad Inst Automat Technol, Taipei 106344, Taiwan				2021-05-24	WOS:000644012400001

However, the diversity of defects and the complexity of ambient conditions make it challenging to develop an effective and robust classification and detection algorithm. In this study, we adopted a semi-supervised learning approach to train ResNet-18 for image feature retrieval and then classification and detection of pavement defects. The resulting feature embedding vectors from image patches were retrieved, concatenated, and randomly sampled to model a multivariate normal distribution based on the only one-class training pavement image dataset. The calibration pavement image dataset was used to determine the defect score threshold based on the receiver operating characteristic curve, with the Mahalanobis distance employed as a metric to evaluate differences between normal and defect pavement images. Finally, a heatmap derived from the defect score map for the testing dataset was overlaid on the original pavement images to provide insight into the network's decisions and guide measures to improve its performance. The results demonstrate that the model's classification accuracy improved from 0.868 to 0.887 using the expanded and augmented pavement image data based on the analysis of heatmaps.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2				1424-8220										Nantong Univ, Sch Transportat & Civil Engn, Nantong 226019, Peoples R ChinaEastern Route South to North Water Divers Project, Jiangsu Water Source Co Ltd, Nanjing 210018, Peoples R ChinaTongji Univ, Coll Civil Engn, Shanghai 200092, Peoples R China	Eastern Route South to North Water Divers Project			2024-10-07	WOS:001323761700001	39338875

However, the cost per mile of the existing condition data collection methods allows only for periodical surveys. This leads to long gaps between inspections and a focus on major roads over rural ones. Therefore, pavement condition monitoring systems that provide inexpensive frequent updates on the road condition are necessary. Such systems would require robust and automatic defect detection methods using low-cost sensors. In this paper, one such method is proposed for detecting road patches from video data acquired by the car's parking camera. A patch is initially detected based on its visual characteristics, which are: 1) it consists of a closed contour and 2) its texture is the same with the surrounding intact pavement. The patch is then passed to a kernel tracker in order to trace it in subsequent video frames. This way redetection is avoided and each patch is reported only once. The method was implemented in a C# prototype and tested with video data consisting of approximately 4000 frames collected from roads in Cambridge, UK. The results show that the suggested method has 84% precision and 96% recall. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

A method for patching roads is that the defective pavement area is milled, cleaned from dust and ground, treated with bitumen emulsion, after which the mixture is placed and rolled. The asphalt mix is placed in the pothole with arrangement of a small conical mound near the edge of the arranged pavement, before the drum of the road roller, with account to the pressing-out of the road material towards the edges of the pad when the roller runs over the mixture, and for compacting the asphalt mix a compact vibratory roller is used in the dynamic operation mode; the final stage of compaction process is the use of plate compactors for additional compacting of the borders of the repair area after the vibratory roller.

Current practice is predominantly manual with only 0.4% of inspections happening automatically. All methods in the literature aiming at automating condition assessment focus on two defects at most, or are too expensive for practical application. In this paper, the authors propose a low-cost method that automatically detects pavement defects simultaneously using parking camera video data. The types of defects addressed in this paper are two types of cracks (longitudinal and transverse), patches, and potholes. The method uses the semantic texton forests (STFs) algorithm as a supervised classifier on a calibrated region of interest (myROI), which is the area of the video frame depicting only the usable part of the pavement lane. It is validated using data collected from the local streets of Cambridge, U.K. Based on the results of multiple experiments, the overall accuracy of the method is above 82%, with a precision of more than 91% for longitudinal cracks, more than 81% for transverse cracks, more than 88% for patches, and more than 76% for potholes. The duration for training and classifying spans from 25 to 150min, depending on the number of video frames used for each experiment. The contribution of this paper is dual: (1)an automated method for detecting several pavement defects at the same time, and (2)a method for calculating the region of interest within a video frame considering pavement manual guidelines.

To address this limitation, this study proposes an automated patch detection system that employs object detection techniques. The results demonstrate the ability of object detection models to accurately identify patches in laser profiling images, indicating that the proposed approach has the capability to significantly enhance automation in visual inspection processes. This has the potential for significant cost reduction in inspections, improved safety conditions during checks, and acceleration of the current manual inspection processes.					14th International Conference on Computer Vision Systems (ICVS)14th International Conference on Computer Vision Systems (ICVS)	SEP 27-29, 2023SEP 27-29, 2023		Vienna, AUSTRIAVienna, AUSTRIA	0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0302-9743	1611-3349	978-3-031-44136-3; 978-3-031-44137-0									Technol Univ, Sch Comp Sci, Dublin, IrelandPavement Management Serv Ltd Athenry Co, Galway, Ireland	Technol UnivPavement Management Serv Ltd Athenry Co			2024-03-19	WOS:001160756900018

In this study, a RGB-D sensor is used to detect and quantify defects in pavements. This sensor system consists of a RGB color image, and an infrared projector and a camera that act as a depth sensor. An approach, which does not need any training, is proposed to interpret the data sensed by this inexpensive sensor. This system has the potential to be used for autonomous cost-effective assessment of road-surface conditions. Various road conditions including patching, cracks, and potholes are autonomously detected and, most importantly, quantified, using the proposed approach. Several field experiments have been carried out to evaluate the capabilities, as well as the limitations of the proposed system. The global positioning system information is incorporated with the proposed system to localize the detected defects. This approach has the potential to be deployed as a supplementary sensor system in pavement surface-assessment vehicles and reduce the operation cost.

Newly emerging technologies based on non-destructive testing techniques, do not demand implementing destructive measures or relying on extrapolation of point data and can be implemented after developing them into a proper technique and a set testing protocol. One such emerging technique that uses infrared emissions from any structure to inspect underlying defects is infrared thermography (IRT). In a patch of pavement containing subsurface defects, the heat flow to the surface of the pavement, which itself depends on the incident solar radiation, ambient temperature and other meteorological factors, gets disrupted causing a difference in the thermal signature of the defective and the sound patches. This difference in thermal signature can potentially be detected by a thermal imaging camera. This study aims at exploring the potential of IRT technique to assess the subsurface debonding defect in asphalt pavements. For this purpose, an in situ asphalt pavement test section has been constructed and different interlayer bonding conditions have been artificially induced in it. A novel way for quantitative and qualitative analyses of thermal signatures, using MATLAB for each of these bonding conditions has been carried out. The effect of different debonding agents on the overall thermal behavior of asphalt pavement has also been evaluated. Interchange time duration between day heating and night cooling cycles has been estimated, to determine the suitable time duration for asphalt pavement inspection. The results, advantages, and limitations of the method have been presented.									27	1	0	0	0	0	27			2190-5452	2190-5479										Birla Inst Technol & Sci Pilani, Dept Civil Engn, Pilani, Rajasthan, India				2019-08-02	WOS:000476541200002

This paper presents a study on the detection of roadway pavement anomalies by use of smartphone sensors and on-board diagnostic (OBD-II) devices, which can lead to low-cost roadway infrastructure assessment. The proposed approach, which, in addition to smartphone sensors, also utilizes artificial neural network (ANN) techniques in the analysis, captures a vehicle's interaction with a roadway pavement while the vehicle is moving, and utilizes the observed interaction patterns for the detection of potholes in the pavement. The method utilizes four metrics in the analysis and shows a detection accuracy of about 90%. Preliminary results on the inclusion of additional roadway defects in the analysis and on the ability of the method to distinguish between potholes and other pavement defects (e.g., patches, local upheavals, rutting, and corrugation) have been positive. The study's results confirm the value of smartphone sensors in the low-cost (and eventually crowdsourced) detection of potholes.									29	0	0	0	0	0	30			1076-0342	1943-555X										Univ Cyprus, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, CY-1087 Nicosia, Cyprus				2019-08-02	WOS:000475476000004

This, in turn, contributes to the growth and prosperity of nations and enables users to enjoy the highest levels of luxury and comfort. Despite numerous studies and ongoing research, finding the most precise and efficient monitoring systems to determine the type and severity of road defects, their causes, and appropriate treatments remains a challenge. This study proposes a system that employs a camera to create an application capable of evaluating road conditions with ease by taking images while driving over the road. Based on the results, the application was accurate in identifying road defects of different severity within the same category. The proposed method was compared to the Pavement Condition Index (PCI) method, and a significant match was found in determining the type and severity of each defect on the selected road sections. More clearly, the overall accuracy of detecting and classifying block cracks, alligator cracks, longitudinal cracks, and potholes was significant for detecting and classifying the patches.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				2071-1050										Jordan Univ Sci & Technol, Dept City Planning & Design, Irbid 22110, JordanJordan Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Civil Engn, Irbid 22110, JordanJadara Univ, Fac Engn, Commun & Comp Dept, Irbid 21110, JordanRMIT Univ, Sch Engn, Melbourne 3001, Australia	Jadara Univ			2025-03-31	WOS:001453786500001

The research aims to investigate asphalt pavements, analyzing the variations in the responses, which can reveal the presence of pathologies or defects. A case study was made acquiring data, at the State University of Campinas - UNICAMP, in Campinas - SP - Brazil, with antennae 270 and 1600 MHz, in pavements with visible defects of patching and alligator cracks, initially with the dry structure and later, wet. The results were processed in specialized software (Radan 7.0) to generate terrain profiles. The GPR showed effective when there is a change in material employed as in the case of patching, because it was possible to detect layers compromised by intensive request of traffic, the start and end of application of the patching and even deformations in the new layer. In contrast, the alligator cracking did not reach the same result, not presenting accuracy in recognizing the defect. The extent of defect was the only well defined feature in the images.

Climatic factors are unavoidable and can affect the properties of asphalt mixtures, making them weaker and less durable. Thus, continuous monitoring of bituminous surfaces is something that can reduce the risks of public health. Remote sensing techniques have become an effective, noninvasive method for early detection of damaged asphalt pavements. This paper outlines a range of different remote sensing methodologies that can be used to monitor asphalt road pavements. This is complemented by the use of field spectroscopy for the examination of asphalt pavements of varying age and conditions. The results of the study found spectral differences regarding asphalt defects, such as physical cracking, patched cracking and polishing. These spectral changes were examined through "in-band" simulation analysis of the Landsat 7 ETM+ sensor, using appropriate relative spectral response filters, concluding that the ratio band 5/band 1 can be used to distinguish asphalt pavements of different date of construction and condition.					3rd International Conference on Remote Sensing and Geoinformation of the Environment (RSCy)3rd International Conference on Remote Sensing and Geoinformation of the Environment (RSCy)	MAR 16-19, 2015MAR 16-19, 2015	Cyprus Univ Technol; Cyprus Remote Sensing Soc; European Space Agcy; Cyprus Sci & Tech Chamber; Dept Meteorol; Minist Def; Minist Commun & Works, Dept Elect Commun; Agr Res Inst; Grp Earth Observat; DLR; Hellas Sat; Neapolis Univ; Frederick Univ; Intergraph; GeoSystems Hellas; I BEC; Si Cluster; Spectra Vista Corp; Agisoft; QuestUAV; SPOLMHK; SODAP; Smart Events; Municipal Pafos; Municipal Geroskipou; Pegeia MunicipalCyprus Univ Technol; Cyprus Remote Sensing Soc; European Space Agcy; Cyprus Sci & Tech Chamber; Dept Meteorol; Minist Def; Minist Commun & Works, Dept Elect Commun; Agr Res Inst; Grp Earth Observat; DLR; Hellas Sat; Neapolis Univ; Frederick Univ; Intergraph; GeoSystems Hellas; I BEC; Si Cluster; Spectra Vista Corp; Agisoft; QuestUAV; SPOLMHK; SODAP; Smart Events; Municipal Pafos; Municipal Geroskipou; Pegeia Municipal	Paphos, CYPRUSPaphos, CYPRUS	8	0	0	0	0	0	8			0921-030X	1573-0840										Cyprus Univ Technol, Fac Engn & Technol, Dept Civil Engn & Geomat, 2-6 Saripolou St, CY-3603 Limassol, Cyprus				2017-01-11	WOS:000390688900007

In the case of large scale, the texture feature is not clear, and the information is easily lost in the feature extraction process. Correspondingly, the number of small-scale holes is often very large, which also puts forward higher requirements for the detection model. In view of the above problems, this paper proposed a model for common asphalt pavement defects detection called YOLOv5-PD. In order to reduce the loss of information and expand the receptive field of the model, Big Kernel convolution was used to replace a part of the convolution in the original CSPDarknet. The texture feature information of the cracks is retained to the greatest extent. In order to enhance the detection performance of small defects, convolution channel attention mechanism was added after each feature fusion layer, and performs attention processing on the feature map after concat to find the defect location. This study used a public pavement defect dataset from Brazil. In this work, ablation experiments were carried out according to the task scenario, and the improved effects were compared and analyzed. The proposed model is compared with other versions of models and advanced models, which proves the superiority of the proposed model. The mAP of proposed model reached 73.3% and the model inference speed reached 41FPS, which can meet real time engineering application requirements.									8	0	0	0	0	0	8			1687-725X	1687-7268										Nantong Univ, Sch Elect Engn, Nantong 226019, Jiangsu, Peoples R China				2022-12-24	WOS:000896031900001

This procedure is expensive and time consuming. The new proposed model contributes to reducing both time and cost incurred by identifying a new model that considers machine-learning techniques rather than the conventional ASTM procedure. The authors studied the most common six pavement defects. These defects are alligator cracks, patching, longitudinal, and transverse cracks, shoving, and potholes. An optimized hybrid model is developed to determine the Pavement Condition Index (PCI) based on the FHWA Long-Term Pavement Performance (LTPP) database. The model follows a cascade architecture with three classical machine learning models followed by a neural network model. Using the neural network model as a second stage in the chain allows the model to focus its power on the nonlinear curve estimation to further reduce the errors. Finally, out-of-sample performance analysis as well as a cross-validation analysis is carried out to check the robustness of the model. The results show that the model estimates PCI with high degree of accuracy.									12	0	0	0	0	0	12			2228-6160	2364-1843										An Najah Natl Univ, Civil Engn Dept, POB 7, Nablus, PalestineAn Najah Natl Univ, Comp Engn Dept, POB 7, Nablus, PalestineBirzeit Univ, Civil Engn Dept, POB 14, Birzeit, Palestine				2021-06-14	WOS:000658980600001

The development of object detection algorithms and the popularization of smartphones open the possibility of more automated evaluation processes. This paper proposes the evaluation of the detection of vertical road signs and pavement defects from images produced by drivers using computer vision techniques. A collected set of YouTube videos produced by Brazilian drivers was used to train and validate a convolution neural network model. Results indicated an overall precision of 74.9 %, with observed detection deficiency only for longitudinal cracks and alligator cracking. Potholes, patches, and traffic signs are properly detected (precision between 73 and 95 %, depending on the detected object) for pavement management applications. Provided the diversity of data produced in videos and the overall results obtained in this research, the work herein indicates the possibility of massive citizen participation in the data collection process toward roadway quality.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			0090-3973	1945-7553										Univ Fed Ceara, Ac Publ, 708 Campus Pici, BR-60020903 Fortaleza, Ceara, BrazilCtr Univ UniChristus, Nucleo Tecnol, Ave Dom Luis 911, BR-60160230 Fortaleza, Ceara, BrazilUniv Fed Ceara, Dept Engn Estrutural & Construcao Civil, 733 R Planalto P, BR-60020903 Fortaleza, CE, BrazilUniv Fed Ceara, Dept Computacao, BR-60020903 Fortaleza, Ceara, BrazilUniv Fed Ceara, Dept Engn Transporte, Campus Pici,Bloco 703, BR-60020903 Fortaleza, Ceara, Brazil	Ctr Univ UniChristus			2022-12-17	WOS:000893244800001

There are many places where about 100mm only of the marginal strip is removed and where defects such as widening and faulting are observed. Also cracks arise again from the patched areas due to stress concentration near the joint. Roughness on the widened concrete pavement was evaluated and there are some stations where the smoothness limit is over passed. For design consideration, shortage of the required force in the tie-bar is expected in case of road widening specially from 3 lanes to 4 lanes. Finally the average pull-out force of specimens made from the current practice was about 57% of the required force. New connecting methods were suggested in this study.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1738-7159															2006-01-01	KJD:ART001029589

Inspectors are driving or walking the road network bare-eyed to look for irregularities. Moreover, processing the collected data for understanding the road condition is also a manual task. In this paper, a framework that automates the process is presented. Video data collected from the car's parking camera is utilized to detect defects in frames. Simultaneously, elevation signals collected from accelerometers attached to the car are processed to reconstruct the profile of the road and detect defects associated with its z-axis, such as bumps. A GPS device is synchronized with the other sensors to acquire the data's geolocation. Detected defects are then classified according to their type and their severity is assessed. All information is then transferred via 4G network to a central server, where the Road Condition Index of road segments necessary to classify roads is calculated. Finally, everything is saved in a Pavement Management System. Preliminary results on the processing of video data demonstrate the frameworks' promising application. The initial identification of frames including defects produces an accuracy of 96% and approximately 97% precision. Further experiments on such frames, aiming at the detection of potholes, patches and three different types of cracks result in over 84% overall accuracy and over 85% precision.

Additionally, the integration of computer vision (CV) with machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI) techniques has enabled accurate detection of pavement defects, providing foundation for road maintenance planning with less resources. This article develops and evaluates the accuracy of an alternative Continuous Visual Survey (CVS) process using a smartphone mounted on a vehicle's windshield, coupled with AI tools for detecting cracks, patches, and potholes on road pavements. An Android application was developed for smartphones to capture photos while simultaneously collecting time and GPS data.

Advances in deep learning and computer vision have improved the automated recognition of pavement distresses in road surface images. This task remains challenging due to the high variation of defects in shapes and sizes, demanding a better incorporation of contextual information into deep networks. In this paper, we show that an attention-based multi-scale convolutional neural network (A+MCNN) improves the automated classification of common distress and non-distress objects in pavement images by (i) encoding contextual information through multi-scale input tiles and (ii) employing a mid-fusion approach with an attention module for heterogeneous image contexts from different input scales. A+MCNN is trained and tested with four distress classes (crack, crack seal, patch, pothole), five non-distress classes (joint, marker, manhole cover, curbing, shoulder), and two pavement classes (asphalt, concrete). A+MCNN is compared with four deep classifiers that are widely used in transportation applications and a generic CNN classifier (as the control model). The results show that A+MCNN consistently outperforms the baselines by 1 similar to 26% on average in terms of the F-score. A comprehensive discussion is also presented regarding how these classifiers perform differently on different road objects, which has been rarely addressed in the existing literature.									32	1	0	0	0	0	33				1424-8220										Univ Cent Florida, Civil Environm & Construct Engn Dept, Orlando, FL 32816 USA				2021-08-01	WOS:000682222400001	34372380

Twenty-three genes involved in the pavement cell morphogenesis were discovered until now. The mutations of these genes through various means lead to pavement cell shape defects, such as loss or lack of interdigitation, the reduction of lobing, gaps between lobe and neck regions in pavement cells, and distorted trichomes. These phenotypes are affected by the organization of microtubules and microfilaments. Microtubule bands are considered corresponding with the neck regions of the cell, while lobe formation depends on patches of microfilaments. The pathway of Rho of plant (ROP) GTPase signaling cascades regulates overall activity of the cytoskeleton in pavement cells. Some other proteins, in addition to the ROPs, SCAR/WAVE, and ARP2/3 complexes, are also involved in the pavement cell morphogenesis.									25	3	0	0	23	0	31			0721-7714	1432-203X										Lanzhou Univ, Key Lab Arid & Grassland Ecol, Sch Life Sci, Minist Educ, Lanzhou 730000, Gansu, Peoples R China				2009-08-01	WOS:000268500400001	19529941

Image-based distress identification is increasingly becoming an integral part of traffic speed network-level road condition surveys. This allows an aggregated summary of road conditions over the whole network, so it does not require an exact distress location within the lane. In this context, multi-label classification (MLC), based on convolutional neural networks (CNN), is proposed as a potential solution for distress identification from a network-level right-of-way (ROW) video survey. MLC has the advantage of low computing resource consumption, as it is implemented from lightweight classification networks. In this work, the developed MLC models used three different CNN architectures (VGG16, ResNet-34, and ResNet-50) to detect potholes, cracks, patches, and bleeding. The best model obtained 97% average accuracy with an F1-score of 93% in distress identification despite the variability in imaging hardware. This makes it possible to generalize the classification algorithm, allowing versatile applications and incorporating it into network-level pavement management systems. This model has good potential for fast and accurate distress identification from a video survey, avoiding the need for various types of expensive sensors like laser scanners.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			0361-1981	2169-4052										Univ Fed Alagoas, Technol Ctr, Maceio, Alagoas, BrazilAston Univ, Dept Civil Engn, Birmingham, W Midlands, EnglandNobleo Technol, Eindhoven, NetherlandsUniv Fed Ceara, Dept Transport Engn, Fortaleza, Ceara, Brazil	Nobleo Technol			2022-11-09	WOS:000875913600001

Pavement condition index (PCI) surveys are performed manually and used by many cities in the U.S. to evaluate road surface conditions. In this research, a more efficient method is used to detect road surface conditions. This method applies a probabilistic analysis to acoustic pressure data collected from a vehicle-mounted microphone. The data is collected while the driving and processed in real time. Acoustic pressure data contains information on road surface conditions because acoustic pressures change when the tire impacts different road surfaces. This change is audible to human ears, for example, a driver transitions from a normal road to a bridge. The acoustic pressure data used in this research was collected from roads with known PCI values that are used as a reference. To reveal the dominant common features and neglect trivial differences within a certain length of road, a probabilistic method is used to evaluate road surface conditions. This approach uses the Weibull probability density function (PDF) to evaluate road surface conditions. This distribution was chosen because it is closest to the actual PDF among other distributions such as the normal distribution and lognormal distribution. A key finding of this paper is that the Weibull PDF shows the largest change between roads with different PCI values. Another finding is that the Weibull pdf changes when the van hits road defects such as cracks and patches.

To address this concern, we developed a low-resource framework that utilizes Inertial Measurement Units (IMUs) and elementary Machine Learning (ML) classification models to monitor surface defects in the pavement. Our platform recorded accelerometer and gyroscope measurements on a test vehicle's damped and undamped mass while driving on Mexico City's street. We then labeled these measurements to identify and classify general and specific elements of road irregularities, including smooth and uneven road segments, manholes-potholes, speed bumps, and patches. We employed a time series analysis and feature extraction to preprocess the data in both the time and frequency domains. Next, utilizing an exhaustive grid search methodology, we trained elementary classification algorithms to find the best possible predictors and train the ensemble models with them. Based on several validation routes traveled, the overall system demonstrated a macro F1-score of 0.827. Finally, we deployed the algorithms and models onto a cloud instance to process incoming raw data, with resultant predictions stored in a database that can be visualized on a web platform.

The proposed method can image the damages when few numbers of transducers are used or less experimental data is collected. First, the time difference of arrival-based delay and sum (DAS) imaging method is adopted to improve the damage localization accuracy for concrete structural health monitoring. Compared with the conventional DAS imaging algorithm, the proposed method increases the potential number of combinations between the response signals induced by the damage in each transmitter and sensor pair, improving the signal to noise ratio of the imaging map and enhancing the performance of the defect detection and location. Second, to enable the proposed method applicable to a 2-D concrete structure (such as cement concrete pavement and shear walls), embeddable tubular lead zirconate titanate (PZT) transducers rather than conventional PZT patches are used. The new tubular PZT transducers are able to generate radially uniform stress waves in a planar concrete structure. Due to the special construction of the tubular PZT transducers, the detection aperture is significantly improved. Therefore, a few transducers are needed in contrast with the conventional PZT patches. The experimental results conducted on a concrete slab with eight embedded tubular PZT transducers demonstrate that the proposed method can predict the defect accurately and efficiently even with few transducers and less experimental data.									33	1	0	0	1	0	36			2169-3536											Dalian Univ Technol, State Key Lab Coastal & Offshore Engn, Dalian 116024, Peoples R ChinaUniv Houston, Dept Mech Engn, Houston, TX 77204 USA				2018-12-28	WOS:000435522600055		
J	Mhone, Limiton; Kikumoto, Mamoru				Kikumoto, Mamoru/AAX-7764-2020						Field performance of hand-mixed and machine-mixed asphalt in labour-based asphalt maintenance works								INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PAVEMENT ENGINEERING				18	3			260	273				10.1080/10298436.2015.1065994							Article	2017	2017	Asphalt premix for labour-based maintenance works can be produced manually (hand-mixed) or by mechanised asphalt plants - the conventional method. Hand-mixed asphalt (HDMA), common especially in most developing countries, is claimed to equal machine-mixed asphalt (MMA) in terms of durability. Recently, however, there have been concerns about reduced durability of labour-based asphalt (LBA) works. The current study compared durability of HDMA and MMA with a view to establish suitable scope and appropriate traffic conditions for LBA maintenance works. The study was based on laboratory tests - on binder, aggregate and site premix - and field experiments which involved asphalt production and placement of small and big patches of HDMA and MMA on a heavily trafficked Likuni Road and a lightly trafficked Tsiranana Avenue in Lilongwe, Malawi. The study monitored the patch durability for two months after the maintenance work. Effects of the study variables - production method (HDMA and MMA), scope of works (small and big patches) and road category (heavily trafficked and lightly trafficked roads) - on patch durability were statistically analysed. The study has shown that production method affects durability of LBA the most. HDMA had 67% less durability than MMA. Scope of works and road class affected LBA durability by 27% and 23%, respectively. At a level of significance (p-value) of 0.05, the effect of production method was significant, while that of patch size and work scope was not statistically significant. It is imperative of asphalt producers to adhere to proportions of premix components if quality of HDMA is to improve. Apart from improving the HDMA production process, the quality of LBA works could be improved by increasing contractors' access to MMA. The study recommends contractors' cooperation and adoption of production techniques (cost-cutting techniques) such as use of recycled asphalt pavement and warm mixture asphalts in order to improve contractors' access to MMA.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1029-8436	1477-268X										Yokohama Natl Univ, Infrastruct Management Programme, Hodogaya Ku, Yokohama, Kanagawa, JapanYokohama Natl Univ, Inst Urban Innovat, Hodogaya Ku, Yokohama, Kanagawa, Japan				2017-03-29	WOS:000395089600007		
C	Han, RL						Wang, KCP; Kiao, G; Ji, J				A new road roughness deterioration model								TRAFFIC AND TRANSPORTATION STUDIES								776	783											Proceedings Paper	2000	2000	A new model to forecast roughness as a function of age, traffic, strength and maintenance, under given environmental conditions, has been developed from the World Bank's HDM3 incremental roughness model. This model replaces rutting, cracking, patching and potholing with variables constructed from maintenance records. The surface defects have been dropped because good maintenance practice in the study area prevents ruts, cracks, and potholes from developing so far as to critically affect roughness. In the new model, the modified structure number in the traffic-related term is replaced by falling weight deflection. For this non-linear model, a maximum likelihood procedure has been used to calibrate the parameters. Statistical tests indicate that the estimates have a high level of reliability. The model estimates imply that the age-environment variable explains about 52.5 percent of the roughness changes that would have occurred without maintenance, while traffic explains about 47.5 percent. This result indicates a much greater contribution of traffic to deterioration than has been found in a number of previous studies, partly because the relatively thin pavements in the study area are easily damaged by heavy trucks and also because maintenance effects are specified separately.					2nd International Conference on Traffic and Transportation Studies (ICTTS 2000)2nd International Conference on Traffic and Transportation Studies (ICTTS 2000)	JUL 31-AUG 02, 2000JUL 31-AUG 02, 2000	China Assoc Sci & Technol, Engn Soc; Amer Soc Civil Engineers; ARRB Transport Res Ltd; China Highway & Transportat Soc; China Land Soc; China Railway Soc; Chinese Soc Sci & Technol Labour Protect; Chinese Soc Urban Studies; Hong Kong Soc Transportat Studies; Hong Kong Univ Sci & Technol; Inst Transport Engineers; Japan Railway Tech Serv; Japan Soc Civil Engineers; NO Jiaotong Univ; Geograph Soc ChinaChina Assoc Sci & Technol, Engn Soc; Amer Soc Civil Engineers; ARRB Transport Res Ltd; China Highway & Transportat Soc; China Land Soc; China Railway Soc; Chinese Soc Sci & Technol Labour Protect; Chinese Soc Urban Studies; Hong Kong Soc Transportat Studies; Hong Kong Univ Sci & Technol; Inst Transport Engineers; Japan Railway Tech Serv; Japan Soc Civil Engineers; NO Jiaotong Univ; Geograph Soc China	NO JIAOTONG UNIV, BEIJING, PEOPLES R CHINANO JIAOTONG UNIV, BEIJING, PEOPLES R CHINA	1	0	0	0	0	0	1					0-7844-0503-4									Univ Western Australia, Dept Informat Mangement & Mkt, Nedlands, WA 6907, Australia				2000-01-01	WOS:000166689600119

It is proposed to use data mining methods for intelligent data analysis and prediction of pavement strength, which allow solving problems of classification, regression, clustering, and prediction using artificial intelligence methods. The results of forecasting the longitudinal and lateral evenness, cracks, and road patches are presented. An original technology for a comprehensive assessment of the transport and operational condition of the road network based on developed modern high-tech equipment, which can be used for all types of inspections, is proposed. It is shown that the introduction of decision support systems for the intellectualization of the monitoring process of street and road network objects will make it possible to increase the technological efficiency of repair activities, analyze defects using a knowledge base, make a reasonable choice of road construction materials and technologies, and manage the repair work, which will allow the application of artificial intelligence methods in the promising area of decision-making on the repair of street and road networks, based on the results of diagnostics obtained by trail labs.

Traditional path voting, based on minimal-path, is performed to track paths based on how seeds grow. The former requires to set a starting point and an end point. Thus, the performance of minimal-path path voting depends on the initialization. However, high-quality initialization often requires human interaction, which limits its applications in practice. In this paper, a fully automatic path voting method has been proposed and applied for crack detection. The proposed path voting is performed to segment images, which partitions an image patch along the potential crack path and integrates the path to form a crack probability map. After path voting, crack seeds are sampled and modeled into a graph, and the edge weights are assigned using an attraction field algorithm. Finally, cracks are extracted by using spanning tree and tree pruning algorithms. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed path voting approach can effectively infer the cracks from 2D optic images and 3D depth images.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			2079-9292											Shenzhen Univ, Res Inst Smart Cities, Sch Architecture & Urban Planning, Shenzhen 518060, Peoples R ChinaMinist Nat Resources, Key Lab Urban Land Resources Monitoring & Simulat, Shenzhen 518060, Peoples R ChinaWuhan Hirail Profiling Technol Co Ltd, Wuhan 430060, Peoples R China	Wuhan Hirail Profiling Technol Co Ltd			2022-02-26	WOS:000756237700001

The terrestrial laser scanner (TLS) will be employed in this project for collecting data, used for monitoring purposes. LiDAR camera mounted on moving vehicle generating 3D point cloud is used for monitoring purpose. Poorly maintained roads result in lower productivity, higher fuel consumption, increased mechanical wear, hazardous operating conditions, driver discomfort, and higher rolling resistances. Road management agencies suffer with pavement repair methods and the finances to keep the existing road networks in good working order. The goal of this research work is to create a low-cost smart road health monitoring system that uses camera-based monitoring and smart phone sensors to identify the road section for maintenance. We have discovered that using accelerometers for pothole detection is ideal for this application. The road patches or pot holes for 2 km area of the RGIPT campus using accelerometer is being done. The smart phone will upload the position and any kind of undulated road surface to the cloud when the vehicle passes over it. Use of accelerometer may detect internal damage of the pavements before it appears on the top surface of the road. When other vehicles move towards an irregular road surface, the cloud will issue an undulated road surface reminder to make sure that the vehicle may safely and smoothly drive through the area. The system is simply dependent on a single phone setting and uses raw accelerometer measurements, which can record irregular driving or quick brakes. The data in this system are collected from the mobile phone and sensor for monitoring and forecasting of road surface. So, every pavement defect has different classification and treatment approach, as well as severity levels.					24th ISPRS Congress on Imaging Today, Foreseeing Tomorrow24th ISPRS Congress on Imaging Today, Foreseeing Tomorrow	JUN 06-11, 2022JUN 06-11, 2022	Int Soc Photogrammetry & Remote SensingInt Soc Photogrammetry & Remote Sensing	Nice, FRANCENice, FRANCE	6	0	0	0	0	0	6			1682-1750	2194-9034	*****************									Rajiv Gandhi Inst Petr Technol Jais, Dept Comp Sc Ence & Engn, Amethi, Uttar Pradesh, India	Rajiv Gandhi Inst Petr Technol Jais			2022-09-28	WOS:000855582700024
